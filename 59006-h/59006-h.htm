  <h2 class='c013'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>“WHATEVER concerns the
manners and customs of a
people, says Rollin, shews their
genius and character; and this is
what may be called the soul of
history.” I am led to think, that
a picture of customs, by presenting
mankind with objects of comparison
at a nearer view, naturally flatters
them more, than facts or dates, the
multitude or improbability of which
fatigues the memory, or shocks the
understanding. This is the reason
why we prefer the private life of a
hero, to the history of his great
actions; the one gives us a secret
satisfaction in which self-love finds
its account: the other produces only
astonishment. The hero is too distant
from us; we admire him too
much to presume to compare with
him: ’tis the man we seek; his
heart; his very weaknesses. ’Tis
with still more eagerness we wish to
examine his person; this is the cause
of our liking better to see the portraits
of great men, than to read their
history. We would fain touch the
hero with our hand, as one may say,
we would wish to enter into competition
with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The knowledge of customs and
ancient fashions forms a branch of
literature which is not without its
enthusiasts; this is the favourite study
of antiquaries. Among the histories
of these usages of our ancestors, that
of the beard holds a distinguished
rank; and though at present, from
its little importance, it is become an
object of ridicule, it has been held in
high consideration in different ages
and among different people. Never
was there any thing like that caused
so many troubles and so much ill
blood: the cowls of the disciples of
St. Francis never occasioned so much
noise.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The beard, which has been
worn and highly respected at some
periods, and despised at others, is
become the sport of every witling.
This mark of manhood, which was
held sacred among the Hebrews and
primitive Christians, highly condemned
by some popes, and particularly
countenanced by others, has been successively
considered by the Roman
church, as an odious heterodoxy, or
the symbol of wisdom and Christian
humility. Like objects of great
worth, the beard never excited petty
quarrels; both its enemies and partisans
were violent: these anecdotes,
so strange in this age, will not only
amuse the reader, but discover the
character of the people, the spirit of
the times, and the narrowness of the
human understanding.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f1'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>During the pontificates of Clement VII. and
Paul III. there were long and warm disputes between
the Capuchins and Observantins about
cowls, whether they should be square, round,
sharp-pointed, oblong, &amp;c. Boverius, the annalist
of the Capuchins, wrote a geometrical
work, containing eleven demonstrations, in order
to fix the real form of the cowl of St. Francis.
Wigs, among the clergy, have likewise caused
terrible disputes. The Sulpicians alone have
withstood this fashion with a laudable resolution.
 Mr. de Thiers wrote a history of wigs, which, as
well as the history of cowls, evinces the narrowness
of the human mind, and justly exposes it to
ridicule. <i>O curas hominum!</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It must appear a strange paradox,
perfectly shocking for crazy old beaus,
for priests whose beards are always
shaved close, in short, for all those
that compose the effeminate part of
the human species, to hear any one
maintain, that a long beard becomes
a man’s dignity, and that it is beneficial
to health and good morals; his
ideas must be very different from those
of the present age. This however is
what I have presumed to do. But
whether the design of this work be
serious or ironical, it has at least the
appearance of novelty; and that’s a
great deal in this age.</p>

<p class='c009'>To write an apology for long beards
is to recall to men’s minds their ancient
dignity, and that superiority of
their sex which has been lost in Europe
ever since the fabulous days of
chivalry. This too is not the way
to gain the good opinion of the ladies,
seeing that it’s an attempt to diminish
their authority; but at the same time
it is restoring, in some respects, the
sovereign power to the lawful master,
and taking it from the usurper:
Moliere says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Du côté  de la barbe est la toute puissance.</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Power is on the side of the beard.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This is not very polite; but when a
man is determined to speak the truth,
it is often very difficult to be so.</p>

<p class='c009'>To prove clearly that our priests
are obliged, not only by reason, but
by human and divine laws, to wear a
long beard, is an idea that appears to
me as singular as new; but to employ
methodically the most authentic and
most sacred authorities, to display erudition
at every moment, and to preserve
always an air of gravity, in
order to support this argument, might
draw on me, from my readers, the
reproach of having given too much
importance to a subject that does not
appear worthy of it. I will freely
confess I have been led away by my
subject, and that I thought it necessary
to assume the tone of inquiry, because
most of the proofs which I shall bring
to my aid, are of a nature not easy to
be reconciled to the spirit of irony.
But this inquiry is sometimes enlivened
by diverting anecdotes little
known; and though my chapter <i>Of
the Beards of Priests</i> is longer and
more loaded with citations than the
rest, I’m of opinion it will not be
thought the least curious.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the conclusion I have laid aside
jesting, and this perhaps may be
thought the greatest defect; in composing
it I found it impossible not to
be serious: the gravity of the subject
no doubt had an influence on my ideas,
and I will not attempt to say any
thing in my own defence.</p>

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c013'>CHAP. I.<br /> <br /><i>Of <span class='sc'>Fashion</span>.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>IF we were well persuaded that most new
fashions are invented to hide some secret
imperfections of the body, or to satisfy
the avidity of shopkeepers, it is most
likely we should consider it of less importance;
for, if we seek the cause of these
changes, we find in general it proceeds
from the ingenious ardour of a milliner,
the bad shape of some fine lady, the long
visage of a second, and the broad foot of
a beau parson.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first woman that ever wore a
<i>fardingale</i> wanted to conceal the indiscreet
fruit of her gallantry. This sort
of hoop, of a cylindrical form, entirely
concealed the waist. In a little time
all the ladies followed this example; and
every fashionable fair-one appeared as
if her lover had brought her in the
same situation as she that introduced the
fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great large ruffs, which looked
like a glory about the people’s necks, in
the time of Henry IV.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> were invented
in Spain to hide the hernia gutturis, a very
common disorder among the Spaniards.
Though the French had not this disorder,
they eagerly adopted the new fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is most likely the fear of being sunburnt,
or else that refined coquetry which
conceals from public view what it means
to raise a desire for, determined the ladies
to cover their faces with a mask of black
velvet. No lady was seen abroad without
her mask. Tradition says nothing of the
cause of this fashion; but there is no
doubt but ugliness and decrepitness invented
another sort of mask, which our
old tabbies still continue the use of: this
is a plaster of white lead and vermillion,
laid on so thick, that it represents much
better the ruddy countenance of a drunken
sot, than the fine lively complexion of
a beautiful damsel.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the reign of Francis II. a tunbellied
Person of high rank turned the heads of all
the French. Every body was mad to have,
not only a great belly, but likewise a very
large false rump. At present, our ladies
have not revived the fashion of great bellies;
on the contrary, it has been remarked
that they have a great dislike to them:
but one of them, who had a bad shape,
appearing with an enormous rump and
hips, all the rest would have false ones;
and all the well made women concealed
their shape, as the others did their defects.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f2'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Henry IV. of France was the contemporary of Queen
Elizabeth. T.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Geffrey Plantagenet, count of Anjou,
one of the most accomplished and handsome
men of his time, had the misfortune
to have a large excrescence on the
tip of his great toe; in order to conceal
this imperfection, and walk easy, he had
some shoes made with points turned up
of a sufficient length not to pinch him.
No sooner had he these shoes, than every
one was anxious to be like the count.
This fashion was so much followed, and
had such a run, that the different degrees
of rank were known by the length of the
points of the shoes. Those of the common
people were six inches long, those of
citizens a foot; but those of gentlemen,
lords, and princes, were never less than
two feet; from whence came the French
proverb <i>Etre fur un grand pied</i> (to be in
easy circumstances). These points to the
shoes increased so in length, that it was
feared lest they should affect public order
and the established religion: sermons
were preached and ordinances issued against
them; the clergy anathematized
them, and Charles V. expressly forbade
their being worn.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus, every one appeared as if he had
an excrescence on the tip of his great toe;
so likewise, in most fashions, every one
seems desirous of concealing imperfections
that he has not.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fashions have for a long time been considered
as of great importance among the
French, and their neighbours have often
reproached them with it.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> If a new
fashion appear, the whole nation is in an
uproar: all are infatuated, mad: every
one is in a hurry to have it; the contagion
soon reaches all ranks; they seem as
if they could never be soon enough more
ridiculous than they were the day before.
Taste is out of the question; ’tis opinion
alone that decides. Were the new fashion
ever so silly, not a word would be
said against it, because of this sole and
powerful reason: <i>It is what is worn at
present.</i></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f3'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Baptist Mantuan, an Italian and Latin Poet, said of the
French:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——<i>Cito mobile pectus</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Cordaque largitus, rerum sitibunda novarum.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Another Italian said, about two centuries ago: <i>E Natione la
Franceze che mai persiste ne sta ferme in una sorte d’habito, ma
lo varie secondo i caprici. De gli habiti antichi &amp; moderni.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The motive that actuates people to be
at the height of the mode, is the vanity
of being thought a person of consequence.
How many are there who are penetrated
with respect at the sight of a fine coat!
how many are there who owe all the consideration
they have to their outward appearance,
and who might justly say: <i>Ah!
my coat, how much I am obliged to you!</i>
Their whole merit is in their wardrobe;
and there is many a Frenchman, who, had
he but that to his mind, would envy no
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>One sole form of a coat, let it be ever
so elegant, would be insufficient to preserve
the veneration of so many stupid
asses; their idol must be differently set
off every day: without that precaution
their admiration would soon be over;
this perhaps is what most contributes to
keep up the love of novelty among the
French. Peter the Great, emperor of
Russia, was struck, when at Paris, with
this national character; not being much
accustomed to see a variety of dresses, he
said, on seeing a lord in a different coat
every day: <i>Surely that man is dissatisfied
with his tailor.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>Why should we not have a dictionary
Of Fashions? Surely it would be of as
much use as many others. The different
denominations which we give them would
not be the least entertaining part of the
work. Among the names of old hoops
we find the <i>Gourgandine</i> (the flirting
hoop), the <i>Boute-en-train</i> (the leading-mode hoop),
the <i>Tatez-y</i> (the groping
hoop), the <i>Culbute</i> (the flying-top-over-tail
hoop), &amp;c. Hats and shoes would
likewise afford long articles. Then again
there would be the great wigs worn in
the reign of Lewis XIV.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and which so
much employed the attention of the courtiers
and periwig-makers of that age:
not only the head, but half the body was
buried under this heap of curls. It was
then only the outside of a Frenchman’s
head that was ridiculous; now-a-days
things are changed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I would not have forgotten under the
word <i>canon</i> the blunder of a German
author, who, having translated Moliere’s
<i>Précieuses ridicules</i>, and intending to bring
this piece out at one of the theatres of
his nation, was confoundedly puzzled
how to explain this word. It never entered
his brain that a <i>canon</i> was a piece of
muslin worn round the knee. After maturely
considering the passage, he resolved
that Mascarille should have a brace of pistols
in his pocket, which he was to pull out
when he asks: <i>How do you like my canons?</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The article of ladies’ head-dresses
would fill a volume entire: we should
find, that, in proportion as they have
taken from their heads, they have added
to their hips. The enormous hoop and
the large high head-dress have alternately
succeeded each other; these last
have lately sunk under their own weight,
if I may be allowed the expression, in
order to let the great hips and false
rumps be in vogue. The ladies are determined
not to lose any of their bulk,
so much are they persuaded that their
merit is in proportion to the space they
occupy in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>In one of those revolutions which ladies’
heads have suffered, a lady wrote to
her friend as follows.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>She’ll recover the loss felt by low’ring her top.</div>
      <div class='line in12'>So much for the mode</div>
      <div class='line in12'>Which (however absurd)</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Sets all Paris Ladies in motion,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>But the men’s heads are still</div>
      <div class='line in12'>The same (if they will)</div>
      <div class='line in4'>As they were: not the least variation.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a></div>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Fashion and etiquette are nearly allied;
but they must not be confounded: etiquette
is as stable as the other is changeable.
The motives that produce them
are not the same; the one springs from
self-love, the other from affectation. Etiquette
seems to have been invented by
a desire to govern, and fashion by a wish
to please. Therefore, the former is much
better observed by people of ripe years,
and the latter by young ones. If etiquette
is lasting and fashion unstable, this
definition comprehends probably the sole
cause of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>People change the make and colour of
their dress twenty times in a year; fashion
may be looked upon as their play thing;
but the laws of etiquette return as constantly
as the season. Though it is often
cold at Whitsunday, taffeties must be put
on; and at All-saints day, though it is
sometimes very hot, every body puts on
satins and velvets, and no one is seen
without a muff.</p>

<p class='c009'>At court, among the great, etiquette
reigns despotically; and its power diminishes
according to the distance from the
centre of sovereignty. The unambitious
man, living at his ease on a moderate
fortune, has only a sufficient acquaintance
with etiquette to turn it into ridicule;
while the man who aims at consideration,
or any kind of power, submits to its laws,
and often sacrifices his reason to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are several states of life in which
etiquette gives a consequence to him who
follows it. A tradesman, for instance, to
appear as he ought, should have his head
shaved and wear a round wig; physicians
and surgeons too should do the same.
Who, in this enlightened age, would put
the least confidence in a physician who
wears his own hair, were it the finest in
the world? A wig, certainly, can’t give
him science, but it gives him the appearance,
and that is every thing now-a-days.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f6'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strip a physician of his wig, gold headed cane, ruffles, and
diamond ring: what will he have left?</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Fashion, while it vivifies commerce,
encourages luxury. These are the two
sides on which it should be politically
viewed; it brings together the different
conditions of society, which birth or opinion
had separated. This is a moral
good perhaps; but it confounds ranks,
(which common honesty is interested in
distinguishing,) by not leaving the smallest
difference between a woman of virtue
and a frail sister. In days of yore these
two conditions so very different were
kept distinct by sumptuary laws. In 1420,
prostitutes were forbidden, by a sentence
of the parliament of Paris, to wear gold
girdles, which was the characteristical ornament
of good morals. I’m led to
think, it would be impossible now-a-days
to put such a law into execution, because
it is as difficult to distinguish a virtuous
woman, by her manner, from a frail sister,
as to draw a just line of demarcation between
two states.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c013'>CHAP. II.<br /> <br /><i>Of <span class='sc'>bearded Chins</span>.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>WHEN I take a review of the most
respectable relations of antiquity,
of those celebrated heroes, and the number
of wise and learned men that have
made Rome and Greece famous, I feel
myself penetrated with that admiration
and respect which things sacred inspire;
but when I figure to myself the noble
aspect of these great men, when I perceive
on their venerable faces that air of
gravity, that character of virtues, which
their long beards express, my imagination
catches fire; they no longer appear to me
as men, but Gods to whom we should
bow down. Such is the marvellous effect
which this ornament of manhood has produced
in all ages. Even now, that our
effeminate customs so justly paint the faculties
of our souls, the sight of a long
beard still commands respect.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f7'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At the last procession of Captives, at Paris in 1785, the
manly, noble air of those that wore long beards was greatly
admired; nevertheless, these were slaves.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It has always been esteemed in all nations;
those people, to whom nature, too
sparing of her favours, has denied this
characteristical mark of our sex, the Laplander,
the Japonese, and especially the
American, whose beardless chins made
people doubt a long time if they were
men, are sensible of the imperfection of
their constitution and temperature of body.
The Chinese regard the Europeans
as the first people on earth, on account of
their thick beards; and though nature
has been so sparing to them in this mark
of virility, yet they are particularly attentive
in cherishing what little they have.
Both the Lacedemonians<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and Egyptians
have considered it as a mark of wisdom.
In order to obtain a favour among the
Greeks, it was only to touch the beard
of him that could grant it, to insure
success.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The beard was not solely the mark of
philosophy, but became likewise the
pledge of the most sacred oaths and promises.
It has been sometimes the object
of the gravest discussions and most particular
attention of a number of learned
men; nay, most of the legislators of the
world have not thought it beneath their
notice.</p>

<p class='c009'>The most celebrated ancient writers,
and several modern ones, have spoken
honourably of the finest beards of antiquity.
Homer speaks highly of the white
beard of Nestor and that of old king Priam.
Virgil describes Mezentius’s to us,
which was so thick and long as to cover
all his breast; Chrysippus praises the noble
beard of Timothy, a famous player
on the flute. Pliny the younger tells us
of the white beard of Euphrates, a Syrian
philosopher; and he takes pleasure in relating
the respect mixed with fear with
which it inspired the people. Plutarch
speaks of the long, white beard of an old
Laconian, who, being asked why he let
it grow so, replied: <i>’Tis, that, seeing continually
my white beard, I may do nothing
unworthy of its whiteness</i>. Strabo relates,
that the Indian philosophers, the Gymnosophists,
were particularly attentive to
make the length of their beards contribute to
captivate the veneration of the
people. Diodorus, after him, gives a
very particular and circumstantial history
of the beards of the Indians. Juvenal
does not forget that of Antilocus, the
son of Nestor. Fenelon, in describing a
priest of Apollo in all his magnificence,
tells us, that he had a white beard down
to his girdle. But Perseus seems to outdo
all these authors: this poet was so
convinced that a beard was the symbol of
wisdom, that he thought he could not
bestow a greater encomium on the divine
Socrates, than by calling him the bearded
master, <i>Magistrum barbatum</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several other writers have treated of
this subject. Voltaire often touches on it
in his voluminous writings. The author
of the <i>Modes françoises</i> has bestowed many
pages on it; the learned Don Calmet has
not thought this subject beneath his attention,
on which he has written a particular
work, intituled <i>Histoire de la barbe
de l’homme</i>. The Italians have a modern
work, intitled: <i>Barbalogia del Caval.
Valeriano Vanetti</i>, 1760. This Vanetti,
after giving an account of the revolutions
which beards have undergone, enters into
a very learned and serious dissertation on
the various manners in which they were
worn among the Hebrews, Greeks, and
Romans; but the most obscure and least
authenticated part of his work is that
where he warmly maintains, against <i>Van-Helmont</i>,
that Adam was created with a
beard on his chin. I readily confess I
have not carried my inquiries so far into
remote antiquity. In the 16th century
there were a great number of works published
on the beard, of which I shall have
occasion to speak in another place.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the most extraordinary account in
the history of beards is that given by Titus
Livius. Infinitely better than the
eloquence of a Demosthenes or the courage
of an Alexander could have done,
did the beard suspend on a sudden the
ferocity of a people of barbarians thirsty
of the blood of their enemies.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Gauls, commanded by Brennus,
had just taken Rome by assault.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> The
senators, sitting, each at the door of his
house, in their curule chairs, awaited
death with that coolness and resolution
so natural to these high spirited republicans.
Their majestic looks and long
white beards so astonished these fierce
conquerors, that their rage for carnage
gave place to admiration: all of a sudden
they were struck motionless with astonishment;
their arms fell from their
hands. The Romans however continuing
to preserve a grave and silent
countenance, a Gaul, enraged to see the
slaughter suspended by the sight of a long
beard, boldly advanced, (as if to break
the spell which deprived his countrymen
of their wonted fierceness) and laid hold
of that of an old man, who, shocked at
the soldier’s audacity, knocked him on
the head with his ivory rod. This stroke
of the ivory rod destroyed the illusion,
and became the signal of the massacre.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f10'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Anno</i> 365.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Ex Livio, Decade</i> 1<sup>o</sup>. <i>lib.</i> 5.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The beard was likewise very much
esteemed among the old Romans; and
even when they adopted, through effeminacy,
the custom of shaving, they preserved
the most religious respect for this
mark of manhood. The first shaving of
a young man was done with the greatest
ceremony, and these first fruits of the
chin were carefully collected in a gold or
silver box, in order to be afterwards presented
to some God, as a tribute of
youth; this pious offering was mostly
made to Jupiter Capitolinus.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the Gauls were under the sovereignty
of the Romans, none but the
nobles and Christian priests were permitted
to wear long beards. The Franks
having made themselves masters of Gaul,
assumed the same authority as the Romans:
the bondsmen were expressly ordered to
shave their chins, and this law continued
in force ’till the entire abolishment of servitude
in France. So likewise, in the
time of the first race of kings, a long beard
was a sign of nobility and freedom. The
kings, as being the highest nobles in
their kingdom, were emulous likewise to
have the largest beard: Eginard, secretary
to Charlemain, speaking of the last
kings of the first race, says, they came
to the assemblies in the Field of Mars in a
carriage drawn by oxen, and sat on the
throne with their hair dishevelled, and
a very long beard, <i>crine profuso, barbâ submissâ,
solio residerent, &amp; speciem dominantis
effingerent</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>To touch any one’s beard, or cut off
a bit of it, was, among the first French,
the most sacred pledge of protection and
confidence. For a long time all letters,
that came from the sovereign, had, for
greater sanction, three hairs of his beard
in the seal. There is still in being a
charter of 1121, which concludes with
the following words: <i>Quod ut ratum &amp;
stabile perseveret in posterum, præsenti scripto
sigilli mei robur apposui cum tribus pilis
barbæ meæ</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of all the people in the world, the
Orientals seem to be those who have the
most constantly worn long beards: several
nations shaved when in mourning, such
as the Syrians and Persians. Beards were,
and still are at this day, under the controul
of religious usages. Zingzon affirms,
that the manner of wearing the
beard is an essential point in the religion
of the Tartars; that they call the Persians
schismatics, because they have abated
their rigour to such a degree as to arrange
their beards in a manner directly
contrary to the rite of the Tartars; he
adds, that this dangerous heresy was the
cause of a bloody war between these two
nations.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the world knows that the most
dreadful oath among the Mahometans is
to swear by the beard of their prophet.
It is said in baron Tott’s memoirs, that
the first care of an Ottoman monarch, on
his ascending the throne, is to let his
beard grow out: the Tartarian princes
follow the same custom. The same writer
observes, that sultan Mustapha III.
was not satisfied with letting his grow
out, but that he stained it black, in order
that it might be more conspicuous the
first day of his going out. The princes,
kept prisoners in the seraglio, wear only
whiskers, as likewise all the young people,
who don’t think themselves fit to wear a
whole beard ’till the age of maturity, and
this is what they commonly call <i>becoming
prudent</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several great men have honoured themselves
with the surname of <i>Bearded</i>. The
emperor Constantine is distinguished by
the epithet of <i>Pogonate</i>, which signifies
<i>the Bearded</i>. In the time of the crusades,
we find there was a <i>Geffrey the Bearded</i>:
Baldwin IV. earl of Flanders, was surnamed
<i>Handsome-beard</i>;<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and, in the illustrious
house of Montmorenci, there
was a famous <i>Bouchard</i>, who took a pride
in the surname of Bearded: he was always
the declared enemy of the monks,
without doubt because of their being
shaved.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

Denis is given at length in my <i>Description des environs de Paris</i>,

this family’s changing their name from <i>Bouchard</i> to <i>Montmorenci</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the tenth century, we find, that king
Robert (of France) the rival of Charles
the Simple, was as famous for his exploits
as for his long white beard. In
order that it might be more conspicuous
to the soldiers, when he was in the field,
he used to let it hang down outside his
cuirass: this venerable sight encouraged
the troops in battle, and served to rally
them when they were defeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>William of Tyre relates an adventure,
which proves how much a long beard
was valued, and how disgraceful it was
for a man of honour to be without one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Baldwin, count of Edesse, being in
great want of money, had recourse to a
stratagem as new as the success of it appeared
to him certain. He went to his
father-in-law, Gabriel, a very rich man,
and told him, that, being greatly pressed
for money by his troops, to whom he
owed thirty thousand michelets,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and not
being any way able to raise so large a
sum, he had been obliged to pledge his
beard for the payment of it. The astonishment
of the father-in-law was so great
at what he heard, that, doubting if he
had well understood the count, he made
him repeat the terms of this strange
agreement several times; but being at
length too well convinced of his son-in-law’s
inability to raise the cash, the credulous
Gabriel bewailed his misfortune,
saying: “How is it possible for a man to
find in his heart to pledge a thing that
should be so carefully preserved, a thing
that is the proof of virility, wherein
consists the principal authority of man,
and is the ornament of his face. How
could you possibly consider as a thing
of little value, continued this wise old
man, what cannot be taken from a
man without loading him with shame.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
The count replied, to these just reproaches,
that having nothing in the
world that he valued so much, he had
thought it his duty to pledge it to satisfy
his creditors, and that he was determined
to fulfill his promise, if he could not immediately
find the money he so much
wanted. The father-in-law, alarmed for
the beard of Baldwin, instantly gave him
the thirty thousand michelets, recommending
him at the same time never
more to pledge a property, on which the
honour of a brave knight depended.</p>

<p class='c009'>A celebrated painter in Germany, called
John Mayo, had such a large beard that
he was nicknamed <i>John the Bearded</i>: it
was so long, that he wore it fastened to
his girdle; and though he was a very tall
man, it would hang upon the ground when
he stood upright. He took the greatest
care of this extraordinary beard; sometimes
he would untie it before the emperor
Charles V. who took great pleasure
to see the wind make it fly against the faces
of the lords of his court.</p>

<p class='c009'>In England, the famous chancellor,
Thomas More, one of the greatest men of
his time, being on the point of falling a
victim to court intrigues, was able, when
on the fatal scaffold, to procure respect to
his beard in presence of all the people, and
saved it, as one may say, from the fatal
stroke which he could not escape himself.
When he had laid his head on the block,
he perceived that his beard was likely to
be hurt by the axe of the executioner, on
which he took it away, saying: <i>My beard
has not been guilty of treason; it would be
an injustice to punish it</i>.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In France, the wise and learned bishop
of Bellai, John Peter Camus, one of the
greatest men of his time, and one of the
greatest enemies of the monks, was likewise
famous for a long beard. When he
preached, he used to divide it into two or
three tufts, according to the number of
heads his sermon was divided into.</p>

<p class='c009'>A bishop of Grenoble was famous in
his time for the length of his beard.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
Molé, the lord keeper of the great seal,
who had likewise a very long one, having
seen the bishop of Grenoble’s, said, <i>Now,
God be thanked, my beard is under shelter</i>.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f17'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One day, this bishop let fall something, when he was at

</div>

<p class='c009'>What a number of beards should I have
to celebrate, if I had resolution enough,
to do it! what a crowd of names of heroes
and philosophers would come to embellish
this precious enumeration! You would
be banished from it, sages of the age, who
wish only to appear so in your writings;
shaved philosophers, whose effeminate appearance
always belies the glorious title
under which you conceal the pusillanimity
of your souls. But you would have an
honourable place there, divine men, the
pride of Rome and Greece! You, adorable
Anacreon, the <i>patriarch of gallantry</i>,
you, worthy to rank with the longest bearded
of the ancients, who took care to let
posterity know your pleasures and the
beauty of your beard; come and convince
our age that this mark of virility is not
the enemy of gallantry. And you, O Adrian!<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
who, of all the Roman emperors,
were the first that brought in vogue this
ornament of masculine faces, your example
is a proof that the introduction of a
like usage is not beneath the greatest
prince: I would place on your head an
everlasting laurel, and by your side a
French monarch, your wise imitator: the
friend and protector of arts and sciences.
He thought the revival of the majesty of
long beards was still wanting to his glory;
and, in order to insure more certain and
general success to this noble enterprize,
he, as the first of his kingdom, let grow
out on his royal chin that hair which characterises
vigour and majesty. In this
manner did chance favour the wise projects
of Francis I. to restore an usage as ancient
and natural as it was respectable.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f18'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Adrian was the first Roman emperor that wore a beard, to
hide, as it is said, some cicatrices which he had in his face.
His successors imitated him down to Constantine, who shaved.
Beards came in again under Heraclius, and all the Greek
emperors afterwards continued the usage.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This prince being at Remorantin at the
count of St. Pol’s, twelfth day, 1521,
amused himself with several of his courtiers
in attacking with snow-balls a house
which the count, with a party of noblemen
and gentlemen, defended in the same
manner, as is it had been a strong castle.
The national courage was equally conspicuous
on both sides. The vigorous
attacks of the one party were followed by
a still more vigorous defence from the
other: victory seemed to hang suspended
between the Greeks and Trojans, when
all of a sudden <i>ammunition</i> failed in this
second Troy. The besieged were filled
with despair, and the enemy took advantage
of their confusion to storm the place.
The Trojans were on the point of being
overcome by their courageous assailants,
when captain de Lorges, having a little
recovered himself, resolutely laid hold of a
fire-brand, and, Hector like, boldly advanced
toward the enemy, and threw it at
random among the besiegers. The French
monarch, who was climbing up among
the foremost, unfortunately received it on
his head. Both Greeks and Trojans threw
down their arms immediately; an end was
put to the play, and every one was taken
up with the wound of Francis I. who, by
this accident, was obliged to have his head
shaved; and being desirous to recover on
his chin what he had lost from his head,
he let his beard grow out, and every body
did the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>The best establishments always meet
with traducers: the beard was not without
opposers; it had to fight at one and the
same time against the usage, against the
prejudice and bad taste of the age, and
especially against the fury of the clergy
and parliaments, who, as we shall see presently,
wanted in those days to make every
body shave. But the great and powerful
enemies of this mode, far from setting
bounds to its conquests, gave additional
splendour to its triumph. In a little time,
every body submitted to the yoke of the
victorious beard, and, in the sequel, a
shaved chin was looked upon as a sign of
turpitude and debauchery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Henry III. king of France, furnishes us
with an example of the horror in which
a shaved face was held in those days.
Amidst the debauchery in which this
prince was plunged, like a second Heliogabulus,
he carried things so far as to
appear at a ball close shaved. Some verses
of a satire of the poet d’Aubigné  have preserved
us this fact, with the indignation
it inspired. They may be thus rendered
in English:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Henry was well versed in judging the dress</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the w——s of his court: of an intrigue not less:</div>
      <div class='line'>His <i>chin shaved</i>; his cheeks pale; effeminate manner;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sard’napulus eye; so much woman all over</div>
      <div class='line'>Was he, that one twelfth-day, this doubtful animal,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without brains or consequence, such appeared at a ball.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Let us turn our eyes on a more flattering
object, and admire the beard of the
best of kings, the ever precious beard of
the great Henry IV. of France, which diffused
over the countenance of that prince
a majestic sweetness and amiable openness;
a beard ever dear to posterity, and which
should serve as a model for that of every
great king; as the beard of his illustrious
minister should for that of every minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was in this golden age of bearded
chins that those different fashions of wearing
the beard called, <i>sharp-pointed</i>, <i>square</i>,
<i>round</i>, <i>fan</i>,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> <i>swallow’s-tail</i>, <i>artichoke-leaf</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> successively appeared. There were
even <i>ligue-beards</i>. Art was often successfully
made use of to give them graceful
forms; and the keeping of the beard
in order was more expensive to the beaux
of those days, than that of the hair of our
fribbles is now.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a> But what dependence
is there to be put on the stability of the
things of this world? By an event, as
fatal as unforeseen, the beard, which was
arrived at its highest degree of glory, all
of a sudden lost its favour, and was at
length entirely proscribed. The unexpected
death of Henry the Great, and the
youth of his successor, were the sole cause
of it.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f19'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r19'>19</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At the time that <i>fan-beards</i> were in fashion, says Mr. de
St. Foix in his <i>Essais sur Paris</i>, they were kept in that form by
means of a wax preparation, which gave the hair an agreeable
odour and any colour that was desired. The beard was set in
order at night, and in order to prevent its being put out of form
before morning, it was done up in a sort of purse made on
purpose.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f20'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r20'>20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We read in the <i>Menagiana</i>, that a man very fond of his
beard paid three half-crowns a month for keeping it in order:
on which cardinal Campege wittily observed, <i>That his beard cost
more than his head was worth</i>. The same thing might be said
now-a-days of a number of head-dresses.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Lewis XIII. mounted the throne of his
glorious ancestors without a beard. Every
one concluded immediately, that the courtiers,
seeing their young king with a
smooth chin, would look upon their own
as too rough. The conjecture proved
right, for they presently reduced their
beards to whiskers, and a small tuft of hair
under the nether lip.</p>

<p class='c009'>The people at first would not follow
this dangerous example. The duke of
Sully never would adopt this effeminate
custom. This man, great both as a general
and a minister, was likewise so in his
retirement: he had the courage to keep
his long beard and to appear with it at the
court of Lewis XIII. where he was called
to give his advice in an affair of importance.
The young crop-bearded courtiers
laughed at the sight of his grave look and
old fashioned phyz. The duke, nettled at
the affront put on his fine beard, said to
the king: “Sir, when your father, of
glorious memory, did me the honour to
consult me on his great and important
affairs, the first thing he did was to send
away all the buffoons and stage-dancers
of his court.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The tuft of hair under the nether lip
insensibly diminished, and at length entirely
disappeared. This resolution caused
much grief; several complained bitterly,
and obstinately resolved not to follow the
new mode. <i>Le Mercure</i> of that period
bears honourable testimony of the esteem
in which the long beards were held, even
after their disgrace. The following sort
of funeral elogy is taken from that work:
“The beard, which is natural only to
man, is the mark of his virility, and
gives him precedency among his species;
’tis this token of manhood which
adds a dignity to his features, and gives
him an air of gravity and modesty,
which makes him look full of wisdom.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Neither the complaints of the one nor
the elegies of the other were of any effect.
Every body followed the court.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Thou,
O celebrated Mithon, whose name merits
an honourable place among those of

remain, and to preserve it entire till thy
last breath. May thy name, O Mithon,
passing down to posterity, be always pronounced
with rapture! may the most famous
Academies propose thy elogy in
emulation of one another! and may it be
repeated there, in the most philosophical
tone, that thou hadst the courage to appear
like a man amidst a people of beardless
boys.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r22'>22</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Marshal Bassompierre said, that all the change he found in

</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus ended the reign of the beard in
France. Notwithstanding the prejudice
which exists at present, this mark of manhood
has not lost its influence. Whenever
a foreigner appears in France with a
long beard, he not only attracts admiration,
but likewise the confidence and respect
of those that see him. A Genevese,
called Liotard, is an example; he knew
very well how to make an advantage of
this ascendancy, which gives an imposing
appearance to people greedy of novelty.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a portrait painter, and had
lived three years at Constantinople, where
his talents got him to be sent for by the
grand seignior to come to the seraglio to
draw the pictures of the sultanesses: he
followed the dress of the Orientals, and,
consequently, let his beard grow out, with
as much less reluctancy, as it hid the
deformity of his face. On his return to
France, he resolved to retain his Levantine
dress, and after this manner appeared
at Paris in the year 1752. He soon perceived
that he had no reason to be displeased
with his whim. His dress and
beard served him much better than his
talents, to raise him above the crowd.
It is easy to imagine the eagerness of the
Parisians for this extraordinary man. The
infatuation was universal; his name soon
reached the court, where he was sent for
at length to draw the portraits of the
late king and the royal family, and where,
in a short time, he made his fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>His talents, less astonishing than his
dress, did not consist in the beauty of
the colouring, but in the art of taking
the most striking likenesses. The marchioness
of Pompadour was hurt at the
scrupulous accuracy of our painter. As
she gave him one day a hundred pounds
for a portrait which he had just drawn,
she made use of these precious words,
which ought to be written in letters of
gold in the history of bearded chins:
<i>All your merit consists in your beard</i>.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f24'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r24'>24</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This anecdote was given me by a friend of the painter’s,
who knew him at the time he wore his oriental dress. He since
adopted the French usage, in order to comply with the ardent
solicitations of his wife, who was a Parisian.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was likewise through favour of a long
beard that a young Frenchman, about ten
years ago, preached a new doctrine in
Arabia. He assumed the name of <i>Arphaxad
Tinnagelli</i>: his quality was, that
of <i>disciple of J. J. Rousseau, on a mission in
Arabia</i>. His oriental dress and prophet’s
beard concurred particularly to gain him
proselytes.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f25'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r25'>25</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. M——, in his journey to India by land, met this
enthusiast at Bassora, the 15th of August, 1770, who asked Mr.
Pyrault, the French consul in that town, for a guide to conduct
him through the desert. He was returning from Surat, where
he had resided sometime with Mr. Anquetil de Briancourt,
likewise a French consul. “This Arphaxad Tinnagelli,” says
Mr. M—— in the manuscript account of his journey, “is
a young man of about twenty-eight years of age, of middling
stature, and seems to have the Lorrain accent. He gives
himself out for an Arabian, born at Eliatiff in the gulf of
Persia; he has written a romance, in which he has not shewn
a more happy invention, than in his Arabian name. Notwithstanding
his beard and dress, we soon discovered him to
be a Frenchman, which he at length acknowledged. Having
made himself pretty well acquainted with Arabic, he has
written several things in that language, among others, a catechism
called <i>Tinnagellique</i> which begins thus: <i>Who is God?
The truth. Who is his Prophet? J. J. Rousseau.</i>  It was
thought at Bassora,” continues our traveller, “that he had
quitted his pranks entirely; and, on his promising to return
to India and live as he ought, Messieurs Pyrault and Rousseau
(the Persian, cousin to J. James) made him up an European
wardrobe: he came with me as far as Mascata; but I could
not get him any farther, and I left him quite disposed to go
and complete his mission.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There is nothing more eloquent than
outward appearance, especially among a
superficial people. Why then do those,
who, for the interest of their state or the
happiness of their subjects, are under a
necessity of commanding respect, neglect
such powerful means? The beard presents
them with the most simple, most
natural, and most persuasive of all. With
that mark of manhood our warriors would
no longer look like women; we should
have venerable old men and priests more
reverenced.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>IT is a disgrace to man to have the most
conspicuous mark of his virility taken
off; to pretend that it becomes him to look
like a woman, an eunuch, or a child, is
the height of folly and ridiculousness.
Even if this truth were not constantly
supported by the will of nature, the opinion
of all the most respectable characters
of antiquity should be sufficient to establish
it for ever among all nations, and this is
what I would fain persuade my countrymen
of.</p>

<p class='c009'>A shaved chin was always a sign of slavery,
infamy, or debauchery. Diogenes
asked those he saw without beards, if they
had not changed their sex, and were dissatisfied
at being men. The loss of the
beard, among a great many nations, was
always accompanied by banishment. All
the fathers of the church exclaimed against
this shameful abuse, and always regarded
a shaved chin as the effect of the
vilest licentiousness.</p>

<p class='c009'>The example of Alexander, no doubt,
will be alleged against me, who, before
the battle of Ardela, had all his soldiers
shaved. I shall answer, that he never
shaved himself, but constantly wore this
characteristical mark of his valour, and
that, if he ordered his soldiers’ faces to
be trimmed, it was only, as Plutarch says,
for fear the enemy should seize them by
the beard.</p>

<p class='c009'>I know very well too, that Scipio Africanus
was the first Roman who daily used
a razor, and that this mode was brought
from Sicily to Italy by P. Ticinius, who
brought with him a troop of barbers.
But it is good to know, as Pliny very judiciously
remarks, that, of all the nations
that then consented to cut off their beards,
the Romans were the last that yielded to
this effeminate custom.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a>  This proves
nothing more, than that luxury began
to be predominant at Rome, and that
luxury perverts every thing. Moreover,
these particular cases should be reckoned
among transient errors, which, being dissipated,
give to truth an additional lustre.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us take a view of a period less remote,
which, interesting us more, will
shew the value of a beard, the disgrace of
a shaved face, and the mischiefs that have
been the consequence of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the beginning of the French monarchy,
Clotarius II. having a mind to
appoint a Governor to his son Dagobert,
chose Sadregesile, a man very learned for
his time; he loaded him with honours,
and created him duke of Aquitaine; and
the new duke spared no pains to instruct
his pupil; but it seemed the latter no
more answered the intention of the king
his father, than the lessons of his governor.
The wild unruly character of the princes
of those times must necessarily have submitted
with difficulty to the will of
master. Dagobert would not long endure
the constraint which the duty of his
education laid him under. He considered
reprimands as so many outrages. Hatred
and vengeance took possession of his
proud heart, and soon broke out to attack
Sadregesile.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day when king Clotarius was a
hunting, young Dagobert invited his governor
to dinner. The prince, feigning
during the repast, to act without ceremony,
(say the chronicles of France,)
<i>presented him the cup to drink, with three</i>.
This was a snare which the duke of Aquitaine
never dreamed of. He received
the cup with a confident air: and this was
a crime. <i>And he, who was deserving of
punishment, took it from his hand, not as it
ought to be taken from a person of great consequence,
but as it is customary to take it
from an equal.</i> The author of these same
chronicles, who was not a contemporary
however, does not fail, as may be perceived,
to condemn Sadregesile, for having
accepted the cup, and to justify Dagobert
who had presented it to him <i>with
three</i>. Without doubt he did not observe,
in receiving it, all the ceremony which
the etiquette of the court in those days
required. This slight want of respect, or
rather this liberty, was made a pretext by
Dagobert for revenge. After having
called Sadregesile all manner of names,
and had him beaten by his servants, the
young prince, hurried away by his rage,
without regarding the age of his governor,
or the authority with which he was
invested, not even his title of duke of
Aquitaine, rushed upon him and cut off
his beard with his knife. Some other
chronicles which relate the same affair,
add likewise this bad treatment. <i>Prince</i>
<i>Dagobert took him by the beard, and with
his knife, which he held in his hand, cut it
so close, that he cut off a piece of his chin
with it.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>The two authors, who agree in relating
the same affair, were well persuaded, that
the abuse and the blows, which the duke
of Aquitaine received, hurt his feelings
much less than the loss of his beard. This
is the reason of their laying more stress on
the latter. <i>In those days</i>, says one of them,
<i>it was the greatest affront and disgrace a man
could receive, to have his beard cut off</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Clotarius, on his return from hunting,
was far from applauding his son’s conduct.
<i>The king was greatly enraged.</i> The young
Dagobert, to avoid the just indignation of
his father, fled for refuge to the <i>chapel of
the Martyrs</i>, now called the church of St.
Denis. In vain did the king send serjeants
to take him from thence: the writers, who
relate this affair, assert that God worked
a miracle in favour of this young rebel;
they say, that all the men the king sent
were stopped on the road by a <i>divine
power</i>. Be that as it may, this miracle
had no effect on Clotarius; for he never
pardoned his son’s cutting off the beard of
his governor. <i>The king was so enraged</i>,
say the same chronicles, <i>that he never forgave
this offence</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It should be observed, that what was at
the same time a mark of infamy, became,
in other circumstances, the seal of confidence
and fidelity. When a sovereign
took a vassal or an ally under his protection,
he cut off his beard. This was a
sort of adoption which conferred on the
person the title of son. The nobles of
Spoleta voluntarily submitted to this usage,
after they had refused to succour
Didier against Charlemain; they set out
immediately for Rome, and came and put
themselves under the protection of the
pope; and as a proof of their constant
fidelity, they left their beards in his holiness’s
hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>This ceremony was looked upon as sacred
by the contracting parties; and when
any one had promised to adopt another
and to cut off his beard, the greatest rascal
breathing would be afraid to break his
word, and what happened to Tasson, duke
of Frejus, is a proof of it. Gregory, patrician
of the Romans, being desirous to
discharge a sum which he was obliged to
pay the dukes of Frejus, drew the young
Tasson to Oderzo, a town on the borders
of Trevisannah, under the specious pretext
of adopting him for his son by cutting
off his beard. Tasson came without
suspicion; but he was no sooner entered
the town with his retinue, than Gregory
ordered the gates to be shut, and immediately
sent soldiers to attack him. Tasson,
accompanied by his little troop, defended
himself with great courage, and
killed a great many Romans; but at
length he was overcome by number.
Then the traitor, Gregory, ordered the
head of the young duke to be brought
him; and, to prevent his appearing to
have broken his oath, he cut off his beard,
as he had promised.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The same usage had been observed a
long time before; but, in the ceremony,
touching the beard, instead of cutting it
off, was thought sufficient. It was then
held in higher respect. Clovis, king of
France, sent deputies to Alaric, king of
the Goths, to treat with him, and entreat
the favour of him to come and touch his
beard, and at the same time to adopt him
as his son.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The beard has met with its tyrants; the

<p class='c009'>Since William the Conqueror, who robbed
the English of their beards with their
liberty, history does not furnish us with
any relation of this kind more poignant,
than that of Lewis the Young, king of
France.</p>

<p class='c009'>This king, in the war which he carried
on against Theobald count of Champaign,
having taken Vitri by storm, <i>burnt three
thousand five hundred inhabitants, who had
taken shelter in the church</i>, says Mezerai,
<i>as a sacred asylum</i>. He soon repented of
this cruelty; and, by way of making some
atonement, he, at the instigation of the
clergy, consented to cut off his beard.
His austere deportment and shaved chin
greatly displeased his young wife Eleanor,
the daughter of the duke of Aquitaine;
she murmured against this ridiculous custom,
and often reproached her husband,
with looking much more like a monk
than a king.</p>

<p class='c009'>If Lewis the Young’s shaved chin had
caused nothing more than the dislike of
the young queen, the mischief would have
been trifling; but several historians assert,
that it was the first cause of that inextinguishable
hatred which has so long divided
England and France. The following is
the account they give of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Saint Bernard, spurred on by pope Eugene
III. his old disciple, took advantage
of the religious disposition of the king of
France, to persuade him, that nothing but
the undertaking of a second crusade could
appease the wrath of God. The penitent
monarch, who had not hesitated to let
himself be shaved, was as easily prevailed
on to depart for Palestine. Eleanor, whether
through curiosity, duty, or to divert
the uneasiness of mind which the continual
absence of her husband caused her, resolved
to accompany him.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the misfortunes with which this
war was attended, the devout prince met
with one that affected his heart much
nearer; he perceived that his shaved chin
had entirely alienated from him the affections
of Eleanor, and that this wife, expressing
every day her liking for long
beards, listened with attention to the amorous
assiduities of Raymund, prince of
Antioch, her paternal uncle. They add,
moreover, that a young Turk, called Saladin,
uncommonly handsome, and endowed,
no doubt, with a notable beard,
likewise made this princess forget the
fatigues of this long and unfortunate
campaign.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lewis the Young returned from Syria,
still shaved, and, moreover, vanquished:
too certain of Eleanor’s infidelity, in the
rage of his jealousy, he assembled a
council at Beaugency, where, spite of
the prudent and pacific advice of his minister,
(abbot Suger,) he had his marriage
set aside, under pretext of consanguinity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eleanor, six weeks after her repudiation,
married Henry, count of Anjou
and duke of Normandy, who was afterwards
Henry II. king of England. The
French king saw with chagrin this new
monarch, his vassal, in possession of his
wife and the provinces which composed
her dowry; he declared war against him;
and this is the foundation of that destructive
rivality which has so long troubled
England and France. Who would have
thought that the cutting off of a beard,
six hundred years since, should have been
the cause of a war the flames of which are
scarcely extinguished, and which not long
since set a great part of our globe in
blaze.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f31'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r31'>31</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“This woman (Eleanor)” says Mezerai, “consummate
in all sorts of wickedness, lived more than eighty years, kept
up a war for more than sixty years, and left a hatred, between
France and England, which has lasted more than three centuries.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Templars, that order of monks
and soldiers, who had the faults of both,
wore their beards like the Orientals.
Philip the Handsome, king of France,
thought it advisable to destroy these
religious soldiers, and to have a great
number of them burnt. Their execution
was preceded by cutting off their
beards, either to disgrace them more,
or to deprive them of that grave imposing
air which it gave them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soldiers and princes were not the only
ones for whom a shaved chin was a mark
of infamy: philosophers and learned men
have always abhorred these naked faces.
Paul Jove, in his elogy of Francis Filelfo,
relates a trifling event which proves
how much the learned of those days valued
their beards. A violent dispute
arose between the Italian, Filelfo, and
a Greek professor called Timothy; the
question was, whether a certain Greek
syllable were long or short. Things were
carried to such a height, that Filelfo
waged a considerable sum, and Timothy
his long beard. The affair was at length
decided. Timothy was declared vanquished;
and, to save his beard, which
he had just lost, he made Filelfo very
advantageous offers; but the latter, inexorable,
would have nothing but the
beard he had won: he insisted on having
the unfortunate Timothy shaved, and retained
the spoils of his adversary’s chin
as a monument of his victory.</p>

<p class='c009'>When, by an event which has been already
related, Francis I. introduced the
mode of long beards into France, the
parliaments and all the lawyers stood up
against this ornament so suitable to the gravity
of their functions: all the magistrates
shaved, while the young men of fashion,
and all the court, appeared with a venerable
beard. This contrast in dress lasted
longer than it ought to, through the obstinacy
of the lawyers. The self-importance
which they shewed in this sort of
contest, is one of those lineaments of
character which the philosophical observer
should not let escape him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rapid progress which this mode
of long beards daily made, soon alarmed
the members of the parliament of Paris;
they thought it highly necessary to stop
the progress of such a dangerous usage:
being thoroughly persuaded that it was
essential towards magisterial gravity to
be constantly shaved, they made a law,
in 1535, commonly called in those days
<i>the edict of beards</i>, by which all magistrates
and lawyers, even litigants, were
absolutely forbidden to appear in the
Justice-hall with a long beard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Francis Olivier, a man of the court,
who was afterwards chancellor, experienced
all the hatred that the parliament
had for long beards, when he presented
himself to be admitted to the charge of
master of requests: he was at first refused,
for the sole reason of not being shaved.
Notwithstanding the pressing solicitations
of our candidate, the parliament was inflexible,
and Francis Olivier was obliged
to sacrifice his long beard to his interest,
or rather to the childish prejudice of that
court.</p>

<p class='c009'>The parliament of Toulouse distinguished
itself likewise, by pronouncing a
decree which expressly forbade the wearing
long beards. A gentleman wanted
to solicit in this court without complying
with this unfashionable ordinance; the
parliament replied very seriously to him,
that he should have justice done him
when he should be shaved.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><i>There were neither attorneys nor counsellors
in the sovereign courts of justice that
could presume to appear in court on St.
Martin’s day, with a long beard, without
incurring a fine; and this was observed
likewise in the inferior jurisdictions.</i> These
are the words of a writer nearly contemporary:
he adds likewise, that it was
highly necessary to be careful how one
came to present a request without being
shaved first. <i>Such-a-one would have been
finely snubbed</i>, says he, <i>who should have
come with a long beard to present a request,
so much so, that whoever wanted to present
one, readily put his beard in his sleeve</i>.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

says the author of this work, <i>at the ordinance of a certain magistrate,
who commanded all the millers of his district to cut off their
beards</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>An advocate at the parliament of Paris
was a victim to this rigorous antipathy.
They relate, that having presented himself
in the hall to plead a cause with a
long beard, Peter Lizet, the first president,
ordered him, in open court, to
cut it off immediately, or else the parliament
would refuse to hear him. The
advocate was obliged to obey this tyrannical
order. <i>Tome 2. des Memoires de
Litérature de Salengre.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately, these unmerciful enemies
of bearded chins were unable to exercise
their persecution but over the small number
of people dependant upon them;
they would have shaved all the French,
if the nation would have let them to.
But this rage for disbearding insensibly
died away, and, in a little time, these
enemies of toleration complied with the
usage which they had endeavoured to
proscribe: so, this sort of league among
the magistrates against the beards of the
French was attended with no disagreeable
consequences.</p>

<p class='c009'>Things are very different when similar
whims enter the brain of despots. The
two following relations will prove what
ravages a razor in their hands may cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chardin relates, that a minister of the
king of Persia, a scrupulous observer of
the law of Mahomet, wore in consequence
a long beard which he had very
white. It was not the fashion to be so
religious at the court: the courtiers were
satisfied with long whiskers, which they
could turn up under their ears; but they
wore very short beards. The king was
shocked that his minister did not follow
this mode, but obstinately persisted to
wear a long beard. In a drunken moment,
he sent for a barber, and ordered
him to cut it off immediately. The minister,
who was obliged to submit to this
rigorous order, begged the operator not
to cut so near the skin; but the king,
perceiving that he was badly obeyed, fell
into such a rage, that he ordered the
barber’s hand to be cut off immediately.</p>

<p class='c009'>The czar Peter, who had so many
claims to the surname of <i>Great</i>, seems to
have been but little worthy of it on this
occasion. He had the boldness to lay a
tax on the beards of his subjects. He
ordered, that the noblemen and gentlemen,
tradesmen, and artisans (the priests
and peasants<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a> excepted,) should pay a
hundred rubles, to be able to retain their
beards; that the lower class of people
should pay a copeck for the same liberty,
and he established clerks at the gates of
the different towns, to collect these duties.
Such a new and singular impost
troubled the vast empire of Russia. Both
religion and manners were thought in
danger. Complaints were heard from
all parts; they even went so far as to
write libels against the sovereign; but
he was inflexible, and, at that time, powerful.
Even the fatal scenes of <i>St. Bartholomew</i>
were renewed against these unfortunate
beards, and the most unlawful
violences were publicly exercised. The
razor and scissars were every where made
use of. A great number, to avoid these
cruel extremities, obeyed with reluctant
sighs. Some of them carefully preserved
the sad trimmings of their chins, and, in
order to be never separated from these
dear locks, ordered that they should be
placed with them in their coffins. Oh!
Peter the Great, John James was very
right, you did not possess true genius!<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Example, more powerful than authority,
produced, in Spain, what it had not
been able to bring about in Russia without
great difficulty. Philip V. ascended
the throne with a shaved chin. The
courtiers imitated the prince, and the
people, in turn, the courtiers. However,
though this revolution was brought about
without violence and by degrees, it caused
much lamentation and murmuring: the
gravity of the Spaniards lost by the
change. The favourite custom of a nation
can never be altered without incurring
displeasure. They have this old
saying in Spain: <i>Desde que no hay barba,
no hay mas alma. Since we lost our beards,
we have no more souls.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>Well, it’s now a whole century since
we wore beards. Have we gained by
the change? This well merits an investigation.
The Spanish proverb, which
might very well be applied to us, seems
to account justly for our state of abasement.
If, as a modern philosopher said,
<i>stupor reigns</i>, it is, no doubt, because we
no longer wear our beards. But let us
console ourselves; the source of these
evils is nearly dried up. The fashion of
long beards is on the point of being renewed,
an epoch which I pronounce to
be nearer than people think. All our
present fashions and customs are nothing
more than old ones revived, and which
will disappear in their turn. The revolution
is just at an end: the rapidity of
our changes has accelerated its course,
and a new reign is at hand. You pretty
fellows of the present day, Jemmy-Jessamy
parsons, jolly bucks, and all you
with smock-faces and weak nerves, be
dumb with astonishment, I foretel it, you
will soon resemble men.</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c013'>CHAP. IV.<br /> <br /><i>Of <span class='sc'>bearded Women</span>.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>A Woman with a beard on her chin is
one of those extraordinary deviations
with which nature presents us every day;
as to those women who, in order to pass
for men, have put on false beards, it was
in consequence of some particular circumstance:
that there have been others
whose character, seconded by nature,
made them regard a long beard as an
honourable phenomenon for their sex, must
seem at this time more extraordinary;
but it would appear almost incredible
that the eagerness of women to command
should prompt them to make use
of artificial means to have a beard on
their chin, and, by this usurpation, to
dispute with man the symbol of his sovereignty,
and that, to put a stop to this disorder,
the laws should have interfered, if
the authenticity of the evidence which we
have left did not put it beyond a doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is Cicero himself who gives an account
of this singular law, instituted to
prevent the women’s ever succeeding to
get a beard: they are expressly forbidden
by it <i>to shave their cheeks</i>. It is taken
from the twelve Tables; the following
are the words: <i>Mulieres genas ne radunto.
Let not women presume to shave their
cheeks.</i><a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>If the abuse which was the cause of
this law is one of the greatest encomiums
on beards, it presents us however with
room for comparison. The women of
the present day are every wit as envious
of commanding, as those of whom Cicero
speaks; but their means are very
different.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is beyond a doubt that the women
of those days were very far from disliking
a beard. The Venus of Cyprus, (whom
the ancient Greeks represented with a
bushy beard on her chin,) seems to
strengthen this assertion.</p>

<p class='c009'>As to bearded women, and those who
have done themselves the honour of appearing
so, we have several examples.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the cabinet of curiosities of <i>Stutgard</i>
in Germany, there is the portrait of a
woman called <i>Bartel Graetje</i>, whose chin
is covered with a very large beard: she
was drawn in 1587, at which time she
was but twenty-five years of age. There
is likewise in the same cabinet another
portrait of her when she was more advanced
in life, but likewise with a beard.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is said that the duke of Saxony had
the portrait of a poor Swiss woman taken,
remarkable for her long, bushy beard;
and those who were at the carnival at
Venice in 1726, saw a female dancer
astonish the spectators, as much by her
talents, as by her chin covered with a
black, bushy beard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Charles XII. had in his army a female
grenadier: it was neither courage nor a
beard that she wanted to be a man. She
was taken at the battle of Pultoway, and
carried to Petersburg, where she was
presented to the czar in 1724: her beard
measured a yard and half<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f37'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r37'>37</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Russian measure.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We read in Trévoux’s dictionary, that
there was a woman seen at Paris, who
had not only a bushy beard on her face,
but her body likewise covered all over
with hair. Among a number of other
examples of this nature, that of Margaret,
the governess of the Netherlands, is very
remarkable: she had a very long, stiff
beard, which she prided herself on; and
being persuaded that it contributed to
give her an air of majesty, she took great
care not to lose a hair of it. This Margaret
was a very great woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is said that the Lombard women,
when they were at war, made themselves
beards with the hair of their heads, which
they ingeniously arranged on their cheeks,
in order that the enemy, deceived by the
likeness, might take them for men. It
is asserted, after <i>Suidas</i>, that, in a similar
case, the Athenian women did as much.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
These women were more men than our
Jemmy-Jessamy countrymen.</p>

<p class='c009'>About a century ago the ladies adopted
the mode of dressing their hair in such a
manner that curls hung down their cheeks
as far as their bosom. These curls went
by the name of <i>whiskers</i>.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a> This custom
undoubtedly was not invented, after the
example of the Lombard women, to fright
the men. Neither is it with intention to
carry on a very bloody war, that, in our
time, they have affected to bring forward
the hair of the temple on the cheeks. The
discovery seems to have been a fortunate
one: it gives you a tempting, roguish,
pleasing look, of which the ladies are very
fond at present.</p>

<p class='c018'>What has been rendered sometimes supportable
by circumstances, an extravagant
taste, the desire of being distinguished
from the crowd, or to command their attention;
true taste, and especially the art of
pleasing, has always proscribed. We
meet with women every day whose features
are shaded with this ornament of virility.
But very far from priding themselves on
this superfluity of nature, they regard it
as a blemish to be ashamed of, which they
endeavour to eradicate. How many brunetts
especially<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a> are obliged, in the secret
moments of their toilet, to make use
of!... But let us by no means reveal
these mysterious operations; they
have a right to expect our indulgence, as
they tend to please us: moreover, a woman
may very well be pardoned for correcting
this deviation of nature, since the men are
not ashamed to disfigure her.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is as ridiculous for a man to look like
a woman, as for a woman to look like a

than a bearded woman, which proves

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c013'>CHAP. V.<br /> <br /><i>That <span class='sc'>long Beards</span> are salutary.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>THE beard has not only the advantage
of giving a man a stern, majestic air,
of preserving over the sex the empire which
Nature has bestowed on him, and of displaying
on his face the characteristical
marks of his manhood, but likewise enables
the attentive observer to remark, by
more determined changes, the different
states of human life, and gives him the
still more valuable advantage of being
useful to his own preservation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nature made nothing in vain, and the
course of her wise operations is never
opposed with impunity. Is it not natural
to suppose, that this bushy hair which she
has placed on man’s face must have an
influence on the salubrity of the neighbouring
parts that are acknowledged to
be essential? Is it possible to think otherwise,
without accusing our common mother
of inconsequence, and charging her
uniform conduct, (which so fully explains
its own motives,) with folly and extravagance?
How is it possible then for people
to venture to thwart the wisdom of
her intentions, and destroy their effects,
without being afraid of drawing on themselves
a superabundance of evils, to which
human nature is already too much subject?
This however is what we do every day,
in order to comply with a very unnatural
custom.</p>

<p class='c009'>The beard, among men, is the sign of
puberty, vigour, and weakness. ’Tis this
hair on the chin which first tells him that
the time is come when his organs, being
more unfolded, will procure him a new
existence, that he is entering the state of
manhood, that he is going to take his
place in society, and that he is endowed
with the valuable faculty of begetting his
own likeness.</p>

<p class='c009'>This down on the chin is the same with
young men, as the increase of the bosom
with young girls. These two proofs of
puberty announce, in both sexes, that
sweet inquietude, the prelude of love and
pleasure; those emotions, desires, and
wants to be happy which nature has implanted
in the human breast; and at the
same time the power of reason.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a> “The
beard,” says Theodoret in his fourth discourse
on the Providence of God, “informs
these young folks, who have this
downy hair on their chin, that it is
time to leave off childish plays, in order
to employ themselves about more serious
things.” ’Tis then the greater or less
quantity of beard a man has that determines,
in the same proportion, the vigour
of his body; ’tis then that Nature, steady
in her course, requires its increase, and
there is no doubt but our perseverance in
thwarting her will, injures the adjoining
parts.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f42'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r42'>42</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“It is at the time the Devil is in a passion that the beard
begins to bud; and if ever a man has occasion to show some
sign of courage or make some sensible observation, ’tis then
his beard begins to come. <i>Pogonologia.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>If it is evident that a long beard, by
the equal heat which it maintains, procures
glandulous bodies a mild perspiration,
and that it draws away the
humours intended by Nature for its nourishment,
it cannot be denied but that,
the beard being cut off, and neither the
perspiration nor secretion having place,
the humours, which ought to have produced
both, take a different course and
become prejudicial to the parts through
which they are obliged to circulate. This
is the sentiment of a very learned writer,
who has examined the beard under this
interesting point of view. “It is incontestable,”
says he, “that a long beard
contributes greatly to health, because,
whilst it draws off the superfluous humours
which nourish this mark of manhood,
it preserves the teeth a long time
from rotting, and strengthens the gums,
an advantage which those who shave are
generally deprived of, who, almost all,
are tormented with a dreadful pain in
the teeth, and lose them all before they
are any way advanced in age. The
beard, in summer,” continues the same
author, “defends the face from the burning
rays of the sun; and in winter from
rimes. In short, it preserves a man from
a number of disorders, such as the quinsy
and the decay of the palate, &amp;c.”<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
Adrian Junius, a physician who lived in
the sixteenth century, in his commentary
on the hair of the head, asserts that the
beard is a preservative against several disorders.
Gentien Hervet, in one of his
discourses on beards, relates, that after
the council of Trent, several ecclesiastics,
being obliged to shave, were some time
after seized with a violent tooth ach. I
may add to these authorities what I have
been told by very credible persons. A
German gentleman, having been a long
time tormented with a violent pain in his
teeth, was advised to let his beard grow
out, and he was entirely indebted to this
remedy for his cure.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f43'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r43'>43</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pierius Valerianus, <i>Pro Sacerdotum barbis</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The ancients seem to have been more
sensible than we of the particular virtue
of this ornament of manhood. It was not
without reason that they represented Esculapius,
the God of Physic, ornamented
with a bushy, golden beard, whilst his father,
Apollo, had a shaved chin.</p>

<p class='c009'>This symbolical beard proclaimed to
the Greeks, not only that they should wear
their beards, but moreover, by the richness
of its metal, how necessary the beard
was to their health. It was not with impunity,
say several writers, that Dionysius
the tyrant took away this golden fleece
from the God of Physic: among others,
they regard, as a chastisement for this
sacrilege, his being obliged, through his
mistrust, to have his children burn his
beard with hot nut-shells, rather than trust
himself in the hands of the barbers of
Syracuse.</p>

<p class='c009'>The denomination which the Latins
give the beard proves that they were
thoroughly persuaded of its preserving
them from defluxions and other disorders
to which the nudity of our chins is exposed:
they called it <i>vestis</i> (clothing), and
<i>investis</i> (without clothing), any one not of
the age of puberty.</p>

<p class='c009'>As to us, slaves to the odd customs
which we have ourselves invented, we are
still very far from thinking that it is proper
to look like a man. A manly, vigorous
look is not fashionable, and even health is
no longer in vogue. I see very clearly
that the beard, should it be again admitted
in its turn, may very well cause the
destruction of some disagreeable customs,
among others, that of taking snuff; but,
in order to give an idea of this loss, I will
here place the sentiment of a contemporary
on this sternutative powder. “Snuff,”
says he, “gives a kind of slovenly appearance
to those who make use of it, and
which they are incapable of avoiding:
their breath has a disagreeable smell,
their noses are almost always foul, their
clothes very often dirty, their faces disgusting,
their tongues dry, especially
after sleep, &amp;c. But all this is nothing
to the disagreeable disorders which the
use of this powder produces; and after
the enumeration which I’m going to
make of them, people will be astonished
still more that such a bad custom is not
laid aside.” He then continues: “Snuff
is hurtful to dry, bilious, and hot constitutions;
it intoxicates and discomposes
the functions of the brain, brings
on vomiting, weakens the stomach, irritates
the nerves, impairs the faculties
of the understanding, destroys the memory,
takes off all sense of smelling,
heats, disturbs the sleep, causes vapours
and swimmings in the head, and at
length brings on an apoplexy or a
lethargy.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

by M. Bazoux. Mr. Buc’hoz has just published a
work on the use of snuff, which corroborates this opinion.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>If this account is just, and we may be
permitted to add to it the disgusting
marks which this powder imprints on the
beauty of the fair, it must be confessed
that great obligation would be due to
whatever should cause it to be disused.</p>

<p class='c009'>In ripe age, the beard is the sign of
physical powers: in old age, the symbol
of veneration. What sight is there more
reverend than an old man with a venerable,
long, white beard, receiving the caresses
of his grand-children, the sole consolation
of his burthensome years! Surrounded by
his family, he is the image of wisdom and
divinity. Is there any thing more noble
than Nestor appeasing the rage of Achilles,
lamenting the misfortunes of that division,
giving advice to all the kings of the camp
of the Greeks, and seeing himself the object
of general veneration? Where is
there to be found a more striking example
of majestic sweetness than that of the
sage Mentor? Is there a more moving
picture than that of old Priam at Achilles’s
feet, kissing the terrible hands of the murderer
of his son; and to see this venerable
old man beg with tears the sad remains
of the unfortunate Hector? All these
different sketches may give some idea of
the majesty and nobleness which a long
beard and hoary locks stamp on the person
of an old man. But let any one fancy Mentor
and Nestor shaved, and old king Priam
without his beard and white hair, having
each of them a wig with three tails; this
allusion, at first so flattering, will disappear;
ridicule will succeed to respect, and he will
no longer see in these heroes, but the figure
of our neighbour the churchwarden,
the overseer of the poor, and the auctioneer.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>THE substitutes of art are to nature
what hypocrisy is to virtue: both are
unworthy of an upright man, who is no
more afraid to discover the sentiments of
his heart, than the lineaments of his face.
But if, as a famous moralist said, <i>hypocrisy
is a homage which vice pays to virtue</i>, false
beards should likewise be regarded as a
homage which luxury or idleness pays to
natural beards.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such impositions are more or less condemnable,
according to the causes from
whence they proceed. The old man
whom Theophrastus speaks of, who, in
order to plead before the senate of Lacedemon,
stained his beard and hoary locks
black, dearly merited the mortifying affront
which a meanness so unworthy of his
age publicly drew on him. As he was
debating his cause, his adversary interrupted
him, and addressing himself to the
senate, asked what confidence could be
given to the words of a man who carried
a lie in his face?</p>

<p class='c009'>Towards the middle of the fourteenth
century, false beards came much into
fashion in Spain, especially in the estates
of Cortez of Catalonia. This artifice,
which procured the advantage that a beard
gives a man, with much ease, must appear
much less strange among a people whose
character has gravity for basis. This
mode was adopted with the greatest eagerness.
The same persons had beards of
different forms and colours, and could
change them as they pleased: they had
different ones to wear holidays and working-days;
so that a man might have a
short red beard in the morning and in
the evening a long black one. Every
one changed his appearance according to
his interest. Such a commodious fashion
and so much followed favoured however
a great many misdemeanours; and these
chin-wigs would soon have been as much
the wear as those of the head, if the abuse
which was made of them had not at length
attracted the attention of government.
Peter, king of Arragon, expressly forbade
all his subjects to wear false beards. They
disappeared, and were replaced by natural
ones. ’Tis a great pity this mode never
got beyond the Pyrenean mountains: had
it but reached France it would have acquired
a degree of pre-eminence, which the
French alone are capable of giving. However,
Spain is not the only country where
false beards have been in vogue.</p>

<p class='c009'>About the end of the fourteenth century
there was the largest and thickest beard
seen at Paris that ever existed perhaps in
the world; in fact, it was the wonder of
beards. The man who wore it called himself
patriarch of Constantinople; from his
having such an extraordinary beard, every
one was inclined to believe his assertion:
so much power has appearance over the
mind of man! Never was there a beard
that raised such a sensation. The Parisians,
as may be supposed, were unceasing
in their admiration of it; and it was
through favour of his beard that this
patriarch, as he called himself, received
the most flattering reception. He was
every where loaded with honours: and
this astonishing beard, which attracted the
veneration of a whole people, who were
enraptured with it, was nothing but a
false one.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a powerful effect of the majesty
of beards! but what a subject of comparison
for our manners! How many revered
sages, great geniuses, extolled heroes,
and lords of high renown, are like
this beard! It is some consolation however,
that the homage of the gulled
citizens is always the satire of the delusion
by which they were deceived: the truth
comes out sooner or later; and then all
the honour of it is clearly perceived to
belong to some particular virtue or talent,
or a long beard.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>MEN have, in all ages, thought to
honour the objects of their regard,
or of their worship, by endeavouring to
embellish them. But the means which
they have employed, whilst they do honour
to their zeal, have often given a
proof of their bad taste. Because gold is
so much valued among us, we thought
for a long time, that nothing else could
be truly ornamental. Luxury and devotion
have both displayed it with profusion;
but riches do not constitute beauty.
What was intended to be decorated
is in fact debased. This abuse, which
reigned particularly in the times of ignorance,
has even exercised its power over
the beard. Oriental pomp presents us at
once with an example of this mistaken
pride. Several potentates of those countries
interwove the hair on their chin
with gold thread and spangles. It is not
without indignation that St. Chrysostom
tells us of a king of Persia, who, in
his time, followed this ridiculous custom.
After reproaching the extravagant
luxury of the fair-sex of Antioch, this
evangelical doctor says: “If I should
give you an account of a sort of luxury
still more absurd than that of those
women, who wear gold in their hair,
load their lips and eye-brows with it,
who, in short, are covered all over
with this precious metal; don’t think
I want to raise a laugh: what I am
going to relate to you exists at this
day; it is the king of Persia I mean to
speak of. This monarch is not ashamed
to wear a golden beard; all
the hair of his chin is covered or interwoven
with little plates of gold or
threads of the same metal. This
prince, with his face thus adorned,
looks more like a monster than a
man.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>This is not the sole example of this
ridiculous ostentation: France, which,
as all the world knows, has furnished
models of extravagance in so many different
lines, has not passed over this; it
appears even that it had a tolerable long
run. Several historians agree in saying,
that the kings of the first race prided
themselves in wearing a long beard all
interwoven and set off with ribbands,
and enriched with spangles and gold and
silver threads. Whether this mode subsisted
from the time of the first race of
kings, or was brought from Asia during
the crusades, it is certain, that, in the
reign of Lewis XI. there is another example
of it, which was followed only in
imitation of a more ancient mode.</p>

<p class='c009'>The continuator of Monstrelet relates,
that, at the funeral of the duke of Burgundy,
who was killed at the battle of
Nancy in 1476, the duke of Lorrain, his
vanquisher, appeared with a false golden
beard, in the same manner as the ancient
knights. “He was,” says the historian,
“dressed in mourning, and had a long,
golden beard that reached down to
his middle, <i>in commemoration of the
ancient worthies</i>, and of the victory
which he had gained over him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I am of St. Chrysostom’s opinion,
that a golden beard is a hideous thing;
that, so far from the gold’s heightening
its natural beauties, it only degrades
them. Nature is like virtue, it pleases
without dazzling.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>THERE are no bounds for the objects
that are subject to human fickleness:
every thing changes, all gives way to the
whim of fashion, the beard is a proof of
it. This ornament of man, which the
Divinity placed on his face to mark more
particularly the different periods of his
life, and be the sign of the most precious
faculties of humankind, has not escaped
the common law, but been indistinctly
subject to that of our capricious instability.
The beard, which is the honour
of manhood, and what St. Clement of
Alexandria boldly calls <i>the procreative
beauty, the ingenuous beauty</i>, has passed
through all the degrees of increase and
diminution. Whiskers are a sort of diminutive,
one of those intermediate states
which preceded its triumph, or defeat.
This modification of the beard, spite of
its feeble existence, holds notwithstanding
a rank in history, and merits to be mentioned.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f46'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r46'>46</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some authors attribute the honour of inventing whiskers to
the Arabians. Plutarch, in his life of Theseus, gives the glory
of it to the Abantes, an ancient people of the isle of Euboe,
which we call Negropont, of whom Herodotus makes honourable
mention, book i. chap. 146. As the Abantes were a very war-like
people, they shaved all the forepart of their head, in order
that their enemies might have nothing to lay hold of in fight;
and at the same time they let their hair grow out on the back part,
to show them they were not afraid of being taken in flight.
<i>Recherches fur la barbe, par le P. Oudin, Jesuite.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Whiskers have been worn in war, in
order to fright the enemy by a terrible
countenance. This is what Cæsar observed
formerly in the ancient Britons.
It is said likewise that the Goths and
Franks shaved their beards, all except
the upper lip, which they called <i>crista</i>.
The Gauls, intimidated at first by the
appearance of their vanquishers, admitted
afterwards this custom; and, under the
first race of French monarchs, if we except
the kings and princes, who, like
the emperors, let their beards grow out
entirely, the people wore only whiskers.
This, without doubt, is the origin
of the custom which we have at this day,
as well as most of the nations of Europe,
for soldiers to wear this ornament.</p>

<p class='c009'>As a beardless face is a sign of puerility
and weakness, so is a bearded chin of
virility and prudence; in like manner
whiskers, which hold the middle between
these two extremes, announce youth and
desires. The Turks and modern Greeks
are so convinced of this truth, that, ’till
the age of thirty, they wear only whiskers,
an epoch at which they let their beards
grow out entirely.</p>

<p class='c009'>In every age, and among every people,
it has received a different form; but in
whatever manner it was made use of, or
were the aim of those who wore this
mark of virility, it is beyond a doubt,
that when it is advantageously arranged,
and gracefully turned up, it gives a stately,
vigorous, fiery look, which characterises
the young man, and is not displeasing
to the ladies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the European nations that have
been most curious in beards and whiskers,
we shall distinguish Spain. This grave,
romantic nation has always regarded the
beard as the ornament which should be
most prized; and the Spaniards have
often made the loss of honour consist in
that of their whiskers. The Portuguese,
whose national character is much the
same, are not the least behind them in
that respect. In the reign of Catharine,
queen of Portugal, the brave John de
Custro had just taken in India the castle
of Diu: victorious, but in want of every
thing, he found himself obliged to ask
the inhabitants of Goa to lend him a
thousand pistoles for the maintenance of
his fleet; and, as a security for that sum,
he sent them one of his whiskers, telling
them: “All the gold in the world cannot
equal the value of this natural
ornament of my valour, and I deposit
it in your hands as a security for the
money.” The whole town was penetrated
with this heroism, and every one
interested himself about this invaluable
whisker: even the women were desirous
to give marks of their zeal for so brave a
man: several sold their bracelets to increase
the sum asked for, and the inhabitants
of Goa sent him immediately
both the money and his whisker. A
number of other examples of this kind
might be produced, which do as much
honour to whiskers, as to the good faith
of those days.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Philip V. ascended the throne of
Spain, he found his new subjects amply
provided with beards and whiskers; he
would wear neither, though in other respects
he adopted the customs of the
country; this gave rise to the mode of
shaving. These people saw with the
greatest regret this dear ornament disappear
from their chins: even at this day
they cannot recollect it without emotion;
this is what gave rise to this truly expressive
proverb, but which is a little too emphatical:
Desde que los Españoles no
llevan bigotes, no tienen C——, that is,
(paraphrasing what might offend the ears
of the ladies:) <i>Since the Spaniards lost their
whiskers they are no better than eunuchs.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>Whiskers, in France, have been the object
of the most refined luxury. In Lewis
XIII.’s reign, they attained the highest
degree of favour, at the expense of the
expiring beards. In those days of gallantry,
not yet empoisoned by wit, they
became the favourite occupation of lovers,
A fine black whisker, elegantly turned up,
was a very powerful mark of dignity with
the fair-sex. The women of those ancient
times, less taken up with genius than the
concerns of the heart, and more learned in
lovers than books, made their glory consist
in triumphing over a warrior, or seeing
a haughty, swaggering lover humbly at
their feet: proud of such a conquest, and
jealous to preserve it, these ladies had a
sufficient value for their characters to continue
faithful. And if a favour was the
reward of love, it was often of merit: in
this case, a woman had respect enough for
a man to be sincere, and a man had respect
enough for his mistress to be discreet;
but now-a-days ... what men!</p>

<p class='c009'>The following relation proves how much
the French valued their whiskers in the
time of Lewis XIII. Count Bouteville,
the most celebrated duellist of his time,
who was condemned to be beheaded, seeing
the executioner, who had already cut
off his hair, going to take off his whiskers,
could not conceal the anguish of mind
which this dishonour gave him, and put
his hands on these dear ornaments, as if to
preserve them from the outrage with
which they were menaced. The bishop
of Mantes, who attended him in these last
moments, seeing this new uneasiness, said
to him: <i>My son, you must give over all
worldly thoughts; what! do you still think
of this world?</i></p>

<p class='c009'>Whiskers were still in fashion in the beginning
of Lewis XIV.’s reign. This
king and all the great men of his reign
took a pride in wearing them. They
were the ornament of Turenne, Condé,
Colbert, Corneille, Moliere, &amp;c. It was
then no uncommon thing for a favourite
lover to have his whiskers turned up,
combed, and pomatumed by his mistress;
and, for this purpose, a man of fashion took
care to be always provided with every little
necessary article, especially whisker-wax.
It was highly flattering to a lady, to have
it in her power to praise the beauty of her
lover’s whiskers, which, far from being
disgusting, gave his person an air of vivacity;
several even thought it an incitement
to love. It seems the levity of the
French made them undergo several changes
both in form and name: there were
<i>Spanish</i>, <i>Turkish</i>, <i>guard-dagger</i>, &amp;c. whiskers;
in short, <i>royal</i> ones, which were
the last worn: their smallness proclaimed
their approaching fall. Since that period,
whiskers have been worn only at the theatres
and by some of our troops; besides,
they are less liked in France than among
the other nations, where it is very common
to see all the officers with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man, who should be so bold as to
wear whiskers first, would be a zealous
citizen and a friend to true personal beauty.
What glory would not this courageous
mortal gain, who, braving the present
effeminate custom, should restore our faces
the ancient mark of our valour! He
would bring back to his country that
openness and sincerity of character which
distinguished it from other nations, and
would merit an honourable place among
the worthies who were formerly the honour
of France. “I have a good opinion
of a gentleman curious in having fine
whiskers,” said an author of the last
century; “the time which he passes in
dressing them is no time lost; for the
more he admires them, the more his
mind will be fed and entertained with
manly, courageous ideas.”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> Whiskers
then have the power of giving energy and
valour to the mind. Ah! Frenchmen,
you lost every thing when you lost your
whiskers.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_65 c014'>AMONG the dignities that ought, by
an imposing appearance, to gain the
confidence and veneration of the people,
the priesthood holds the first rank. The
minister of divinity, too often obliged to
speak before a crowd of ignorant people,
has need particularly that all the delusion
of pompous raiment shall accompany him
to the foot of the altar; but this sacred
magnificence, whilst it forsakes frivolousness
and vulgar luxury, should approach
nearer to nature, and be more like that
respectable image of antiquity. Is there
an ornament to be found that more perfectly
unites all these advantages? is there
one that is less far-fetched, that brings us
nearer the first ages, that gives a man a
more stern, more grave, or more venerable
look, and, consequently, is there one that
more becomes the priesthood, than the
majesty of a long beard? Were I to join
to these clear reasons a faithful history of
facts, supported by authentic precepts,
sacred laws, the opinions and examples
of a number of divine men, and, in short,
come to demonstrate the absolute obligation
under which our priests are, of
wearing beards, I should unfold a truth
not less interesting than unexpected. I
might call to my aid the example of the
priests of foreign religions, and point out,
in the books of their dogmas, evidences
of the honours paid to this mark of virility;
I could cite a number of historical
monuments, which attest, that all the nations
of the world agree in looking on
the beard as the ornament most seemly for
an interpreter of the will of heaven; but
I have no occasion for these foreign aids:
it is our own religion that shall furnish
me with arms against the effeminate abuse
which degrades its ministers.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I open at hazard the old testament,
I every where find proofs of this truth.
It is there written how God threatened,
his chosen people several times, by the
mouths of his prophets, that he would
have their chins ignominiously shaved;
which was then a disgrace inseparable from
slavery.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> <i>David</i> saw nothing more respectable
in a man’s outward appearance
than his beard: this is what made this
psalmist king speak so honourably of that
of the high priest Aaron,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a> and think that
nothing less than streams of blood could
wash away the insult which had been offered
the beards of some of his subjects.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f49'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r49'>49</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See the cxxxii Psalm. <i>Sicut unguentum in capite quod descendit
in barbam, barbam Aaron.</i> Tertullian, in his book <i>de
Pallio</i>, has explained the expressions of this Psalm very favourably
for the beard. See likewise Saint Ambrose, <i>lib. de initiand.
cap.</i> 6. At the council of Basil, held in 1433, Henry Kalteisen
made a long commentary on this subject. Sauveur, archbishop
of ——, made a speech at the council of Trent, which ran
almost wholly on Aaron’s beard.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We read in the <i>Paralipomenon</i>, that
this prince sent ambassadors to Hanon,
king of the Ammonites, to console him
for the death of his father Naas; that
this king, having been persuaded that
these ambassadors were spies, had them
all secured, and sent them back, after
having had half their garments and half
their beards cut off. On these news,
David was greatly enraged; and in order
that his envoys might avoid the disagreement
of appearing at court in this disgraceful
situation, he sent them word to
stop at Jericho ’till their beards were grown
out to their ordinary length; after which
he marched against the Annmonites, and,
in two bloody battles, destroyed seven
thousand of their chariots, killed Sophach,
their general, and forty thousand foot,
and thus avenged the insult offered his
ambassadors.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f50'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r50'>50</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See the Vatable Bible, <i>liber Paralipomenon</i>, cap. xix.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This massacre, though it had no other
object than the cutting off of a part of
some beards will appear neither unjust
nor cruel, if we consider how much this
ornament of virility was honoured among
the Jews, and especially when it is known
that there is a law in Leviticus, which
expressly forbids to cut off any part
of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>God himself, before all his chosen people
assembled, was pleased, by the means
of Moses, to explain his intentions with
regard to this decoration of the face of
man. This law does not solely forbid
shaving the chin, as the vulgar translation
of the bible says, which would insinuate
that the Hebrews had already made use
of this effeminate custom; but, according
to all the best versions of this holy book,
we read: <i>Don’t marr the corners of your</i>
<i>beards</i>, that is, let them grow naturally.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f51'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r51'>51</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See the same Vatable Bible, Leviticus chap. xix. verse 27.
<i>Non attondebitis in circuitum comam capitis vestri, neque dissipabitis
extremitatem barbæ tuæ.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>No precept nor other law whatsoever
has since altered this. The divine legislator
of our religion, far from changing
it, respected it so much, that he submitted
to it himself; the Apostles, and all the
most holy and respectable followers of the
Christian worship, have warmly supported
the necessity of wearing a beard; but the
purity of precepts, the simplicity of manners,
and humble poverty, have disappeared
with the times. We have rich
pluralists, short mantled Chrysostoms, and
prig-parsons; but, divines with venerable
beards, fathers of the primitive church,
where are you?</p>

<p class='c009'>In the constitution of the Apostles,
this precept is again repeated: <i>The
smallest hair of the beard must on no account
be clipped</i>, it is said therein: <i>Oportet
preterea non barbæ pilum corrumpere</i>.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
If I trace things on, from the time of
the Apostles to the entire establishment
of Christianity, I find, that all the fathers,
doctors, and saints of the rising
church, strongly recommended the custom
of wearing the beard, and regarded
a bald chin as the mark of infamy and
debauchery. Saint Clement the Roman,
who lived likewise in the time of the
Apostles, after mentioning the Levitican
law, which we have already quoted, says,
that <i>God, who created us after his own
likeness, will load those with his hatred
who violate his law by shaving their chins</i>.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

Apostolorum</i>, the chap. entitled <i>Catholica Doctrina de Laicis</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Saint Clement of Alexandria, in several
parts of his learned works, complains
highly of this abuse so disgraceful for
mankind; he speaks with great warmth
against the rakes of his time, who were
not ashamed to appear in public close
shaved. This saint, who was still a better
philosopher than a theologian, does not
think it beneath him, in another part of
his work, to write the elogy of the beard:
<i>It contributes</i>, says he, <i>to the beauty of
man, as a fine head of hair does to that of
a woman</i>.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Tertullian, especially, says a
great deal about beards, and, with his
usual eloquence, forcibly attacks the corrupt
manners of his age, which had introduced
the shameful custom of shaving;
he supports his arguments by St. Jerome
and St. Clement of Alexandria, and even
goes beyond these two holy fathers.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f54'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r54'>54</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Saint Clement of Alexandria, who is looked upon as the
most learned of all the fathers of the Church, lived at the end of
the second and beginning of the third century. See his book
on theatrical exhibitions, and his Pedagogue, book iii. a work
which abbot Fleuri, in his Ecclesiastical history, calls, <i>an abridgement
of the whole Christian moral</i>.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f55'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r55'>55</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tertullian, in his book <i>de Cultu feminarum</i>, and in that <i>de
Pallio</i>, speaks very advantageously of beards. This learned man,
whom St. Cyprian called his master, was the first who wrote on
the alteration of a canon of the council of Carthage, which
forbade priests to shave their beards.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Saint Cyprian has likewise expressed
how much he thought a shaved chin contrary
to the Christian institution. In deploring
the state of this religion, he exclaims:
<i>There is no longer this religious
devotion and entire confidence in the ministers
of God to be found in the priests; no more
works of mercy, no more order among the
lower classes: the men cut off their beards,
and the women paint their faces.</i> And in
another part: <i>And notwithstanding it is
written, You shall not cut off your beards,
they depilate their chins and colour their
cheeks. Thus, to please the world, they are
not afraid to displease God.</i><a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>It would be too long to cite the number
of respectable authorities who have
either written in praise of beards or censured
shaved faces, who have not only
looked upon it as an ornament conformable
to Christian gravity, but maintained
that it could not be cut away without a
sin.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f57'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r57'>57</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All the first fathers of the Church have strongly recommended
the custom of beards, or have spoken of them advantageously:
such are St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, St. Chrysostom,
St. Epiphanius, St. Theodoret, St. Sidoin Apollinarius, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This opinion of the first fathers of the
Church is supported by two councils: the
first is the fourth council of Carthage,
the 44th canon of which runs thus:
<i>Clericus nec comam nutriat, nec barbam
radat. A clergyman must neither keep up
his hair nor shave away his beard.</i> Tho’
this canon has been entirely altered by
the suppression of the word <i>radat</i>, as
Tertullian remarks, and, after him, a
number of commentators, it is certain it
ought to be thus, which we will prove by
what we are going to say. The second is
a council held at Barcelona in 540, in the
third canon of which we read: <i>Ut nullus
Clericorum comam nutriat, aut barbam radat.
Let no clergyman either keep up his hair,
or shave away his beard.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>After such sacred laws, and the opinion
and example of the apostles, and of all
the fathers of the primitive church; after
the decisions of two authentic councils,
one should not think there had existed
men sufficiently deceitful or ignorant to
maintain, not only that it is indifferent to
shave or not, but likewise that the beard
is contrary to the institution of the
Church. Lighted by the torch of truth,
and guided by the most scrupulous impartiality,
we will follow up the chain of
the different events which have so often
changed the sentiments and beards of one
part of Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'>I find all the popes of the earliest times
of Christianity wore long beards, ’till the
first division into two Churches, Greek
and Latin. Their rivality had already
broken out in the excommunication of the
iconoclasts. When Charlemain became
emperor of the West, the popes then
threw off the yoke of the Grecian authority,
and seized that occasion to distinguish
themselves from their enemies by something
particular. It was at this very
epoch, according to fathers Henschenius
and Papebrock,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a> that Leo III. gave the
Latin church, for the first time, the example
of a pope shaved. The disputes
soon redoubled. Photius, the Greek patriarch,
renewed the pretensions of the
clergy of the East to precendency over
those of the West: he excommunicated,
in his turn, pope Nicholas I. who had
already excommunicated him. Never
had the chins of the Greeks been so bearded,
nor those of the Latins so closely
shaved. Photius, having taken the title
of œcumenical patriarch, declared the
Western bishops heretics. Among other
things, he reproached them with cutting
off their beards. <i>A strange reason for setting
the Western and Eastern empires at
variance</i>, says a great writer of our age.
To think this reason so strange, is making
very light of beards.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f58'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r58'>58</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See the <i>Propileum</i> of fathers Henschenius and Papebrock
for the month of May, p. 209, vol. i. of the acts of the saints.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f59'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r59'>59</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let it be always recollected that we have nothing to do here
but with discipline. Some indispensable invectives against the
divers opinion of the popes, ought not to startle tender consciences.
The dogma, which we highly respect, has no part in
this discussion.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Nicholas I. does not offer any thing in
his own defence against this serious accusation.
In his letter to Hincmar, archbishop
of Rheims, and the other bishops
of France, A. D. 867, he only says, speaking
of the Greeks: “Moreover, they
endeavour to throw blame on us, because
the clergy who are under our
authority don’t refuse to be shaved.”<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
This phrase, which shews that all the
clergy at that time were constrained to
appear shaved, presents nothing in excuse
for this violent conduct. If the pope
could have offered some reasons to palliate
this looseness of discipline, he would not
have failed to make use of them on this
occasion; but he does not give one. Rivalship
was the sole cause of these puerile
dissensions. What a number of disputes,
and troubles has not this ridiculous infatuation
of the Latin priests occasioned!
Had they but let their beards grow out,
they would have avoided all these mischiefs.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f60'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r60'>60</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Quin &amp; reprehendere satagunt, quia penes os clerici barbas
radere suas non abnuunt, &amp;c.</i> Acta Conciliorum.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The death of the patriarch, without
destroying the schism, calmed people’s
minds for some times, and the ignorance
of the times (according to some) contributed
greatly to extinguish the flames of
this violent quarrel. John XII. forgetting,
or perhaps not knowing the animosity
that had reigned between the two
churches, soon appeared again with a
long beard according to fathers Henschenius
and Papebrock.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r61'>61</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See <i>Propileum</i>, already quoted, page 20.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This irregular and inconsequent conduct
of the popes, and indifference for
the true discipline of the Church, seems
to be justified in a council held at Limoges
in 1031. By the determinations
of that assembly it is of little moment
whether a priest be shaved or not. The
reasons of the Greeks and Latins are there
weighed, and the latter are said to support
their arguments by the example of St.
Peter. (This assertion is contrary to all
truth, as all the monuments which have
preserved us the image of that Saint
prove.) They add, in favour of those
priests that go shaved, that they ought to
be distinguished from the laity by their
outward appearance. This reason, were
it just, would be good only at a time
when it should be the fashion for laymen
to wear long beards, and it ought to be
an additional incitement to priests to let
theirs grow out, among a nation who do
not wear this mark of manhood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The others,” says the same council,
speaking of the Greeks, “have chosen
the custom of not shaving; they ground
their choice upon the example of the
Apostles Paul, and James the brother
of the Lord, saying with reason, for
nothing should be concealed, that the
clergy, as the laity, ought to preserve
on their faces this ornament of virility,
as a dignity of the human condition, a
dignity created by God himself, and
with which he has been pleased to honour
man alone. As to the clergy,
they should be distinguished solely by
the tonsure of the head. The Greeks
add likewise, that our Lord of Nazareth
always wore his beard.” By this session
of the council of Limoges, no mention is
made of the two councils which expressly
forbid priests to cut off their beards, nor
of the authority of the fathers and the Levitican
law; this was to suit the circumstances:
and the council concludes on

to reproach us with, we have nothing to reproach
them with</i>.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a> After this declaration,
though it is quite contrary to the fundamental
discipline of the Church, the
reader will be greatly surprised to learn,
that the very same year, 1031, by a canon
of the council of Bourges, all the
clergy were ordered to get themselves
shaved;<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a> nor will he be less so to find
pope Gregory VII. (formerly friar Hildebrand,
a shaved monk, a turbulent, ambitious
man, and the declared enemy of
emperors and kings,) firmly maintain,
that a priest, who wore a long beard, was
guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour
against Christianity. This pope Gregory
was a confounded shearer of beards: he
called a council at Gironne in 1073, where
the clergy were expressly forbidden to
wear this mark of manhood.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a> A few
years after, this tyrant of the beards having
learned that the archbishop of Cagliary
preserved his in all its length, he immediately
ordered him to get himself shaved,
and at the same time wrote (in 1080) to
Orzoc, the podestate of the town, these
orders ... “We therefore order your
bishop, our brother, to have his beard
shaved, <i>like all the Western clergy, who
have  preserved this custom ever since the
commencement of the Christian faith</i>:<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
in consequence, we command you likewise
to oblige all the clergy that are
under your authority, to be shaved, and
to confiscate the property of those who
shall refuse to obey, to the profit of the
Church of Cagliary: make use of severity,
for fear lest this abuse should increase.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This letter, wholly founded upon illusion,
and which so justly characterises its
author, proclaims the approaching destruction
of the little beard yet left on the
chins of the Latin priests. It was at this
time no doubt that those ordinances <i>de
radendis barbis</i>, which we still read in
several communities, were made; and in
a little time the laymen were the only
ones that could, without a crime, wear
long beard; but it did not continue so
long.</p>

<p class='c009'>The German priests soon followed this
example, which is proved by a fragment
of a letter preserved in the new history of
the Benedictines of Black Forest, where
Sigefroy of Goetz complains grievously
to Papon, the reformer, that the Germans
were beginning to imitate the French in
several effeminate customs, among others,
that of cutting off their beards. In time,
the priests saw with pain, that they were
separated from other men by a mortifying
distinction: what should they do to relieve
their offended self-love? Let their
beards grow out? The difficulty of ordering
it, even sometime after it had been
forbidden, did not hinder them; but the
quarrel with the Greeks was yet too recent
for the Latins to think of looking
like those haughty, clearsighted enemies.
In order that all might be upon a par, it
was decided, that the laity should be
shaved: this mean had a very plausible
appearance, and it was decided to begin
with the princes.</p>

<p class='c009'>That of Henry I. king of England,
was the premier victim of the conjuration.
Serlon of Abond, bishop of Seez, undertook
the conquest of this royal fleece.
Easter-day, 1105, he preached before this
prince and all his court: his sermon ran
entirely on heads of hair and beards; he
exclaimed particularly against the length
of the latter, which, he maintained, was
contrary to the spirit of the Christian
religion: his vehement tone and persuasive
eloquence moved all the audience.
The king, penetrated with compunction,
resolved to be the first to give
the example of a sacrifice as holy and
new as courageous: then the preacher,
approaching Henry, drew out of his
sleeve a pair of scissars, and piously sheared
the prince’s chin. All the assembly,
carried away by this act of religion, would
fain imitate him, and the holy bishop
became the shearer of the whole congregation.
This strange farce, which was
not the only one, would appear a fable,
if father Mabillon did not very seriously
relate the particulars of it in his Annals
of the Benedictines.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Some years after, Lewis the Young’s
beard underwent the same fate. This
prince having burnt three thousand five
hundred Champenese, who had taken refuge
in Vitry church,<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a> was soon a prey
to his stings of conscience. Peter Lombard,
bishop of Paris,<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a> assured him, that
there was no more effectual way to expiate
this crime, than to have his long beard
cut off forthwith. The king clearly saw
there was nothing more reasonable; and
this pious bishop executed himself the
function of barber to his majesty.</p>

thought the place beneath him; he resigned it to Peter Lombard,
who, according to Zuinger, A. D. 1160, made use of his episcopal
authority to have all the priests and monks of his diocese
shaved.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Frederick I. surnamed <i>Redbeard</i>, was
not exempted from the common law; the
colour of his beard, the example of two
princes, and the strong solicitations of
the clergy, prevailed on him to be shaved;
and this emperor, who had courageously
refused to hold the stirrup to pope Adrian
IV. to kiss his feet, and lead his Spanish
genet by the bridle, had not the resolution
to withstand the priests on this
occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the clergy had succeeded to
shave the principal princes of Europe,
they might justly expect to see a great
many imitators among the rest of the
people. Far better than violence, the
example would have triumphed over the
remaining beards; but the priests of those
days of ignorance were strangers to all
moderate means.</p>

<p class='c009'>Godfrey, bishop of Amiens, saying mass
Christmas-day, 1105, formed the design
of unmercifully stripping all the bearded
chins; those, who came to the offering
with long beards, were turned back.
Frighted at this cruel refusal, most of the
men were eager to cut off the hair of
their chins, hastily laying hold of scissars,
and even knives, in order to be able to
present themselves immediately before
their bishop with a better grace.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Never was reason the motive of such
indecencies. It seems as if truth had revenged
itself on these silly, superstitious
times at the expense of decorum.</p>

<p class='c009'>Envy, under the imposing cloak of
religion, had just scattered its venom;
vengeance had its fill; every chin was
shaved, and the Church enjoyed its triumph.
Time moderates all things, even
the anger of votaries; they forgot that
beards had been anathematized: the successors
of those very popes, who had
looked upon a bearded priest as guilty of
a shameful sin, were in a little time no
longer afraid to sin themselves, and publicly
appeared with long beards. Such
were Henry III. Alexander IV. Adrian
V. John XX. Nicholas III. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>This calm was enjoyed but a short
time, before a new storm arose against
sacerdotal beards, stirred up by envy and
ignorance, to destroy the work of peace
and reason. The vicissitude of human
things respects nothing. Lewis V. in
Germany, Peter the Cruel in Spain, and
Philip of Valois in France, had let out
their beards, and the mode gained ground
throughout Europe. Priests are not blessed
with a character that shelters them from
the influence of fashion; several were
slaves to that which brought beards again
in vogue. The popes themselves did not
disdain it, though a number of provincial
councils stood up against the new bearded
chins: in 1323, clergymen, by a synodal
statute of the church of Orleans, were
forbidden to wear long beards, under
pain of excommunication. Meanwhile,
according to the quality and condition of
the persons,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a> other synodal statutes of
the church of Beziers ordered the priests
of the diocese to cut off their beards and
hair of their heads, except just the crown,
in order that they might apply themselves
with more diligence to their studies and
functions.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a> A provincial council of
Paris, and another of Sens, ordered the
same; a council of the same town of Beziers,
under archbishop Peter Narbonne,
in 1351, canon xi. forbids wearing long
beards; and as a punishment for such
temerity, it is there said: We condemn
the offender, if a canon, to be deprived
of his daily distribution, and if an incumbent,
to pay twelve deniers for the use of
the church.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a> The custom of wearing
beards was condemned likewise by a synodal
statute of the church of St. Malo,
in 1370, and all sacerdotal beards were
shorn off.</p>

<p class='c009'>The beards of the laity, it seems, were
spared in this general proscription. The
time, no doubt, when the priests could
take the liberty of cutting off the beards
of both people and kings with impunity,
began to decline.</p>

<p class='c009'>The monks had, a long time before,
settled rules for the government of their
chins: in 807, at the assembly of Aix-la-chapelle,
it was ordered, that the monks
should not shave themselves at all during
lent, and that the rest of the year, they
should do it once a fortnight. We see
in the statutes and customs of different
monasteries, that the monks were shaved,
except the lay-brothers, who were called
<i>Fratres barbati</i>, bearded brothers.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a> We
find in old manuscripts the very prayers
that were recited when a monk in full
orders had his beard shorn. Humility
was the motive of this custom, which was
practised with much ceremony. At the
taking of the habit, the beard of the
candidate was blessed with great ceremony;
and when he was made a monk,
he dedicated his beard to God. This
ceremony was practised likewise by the
Heathens. See page 16 of this work.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>This new storm was succeeded by another
calm, and long beards seemed likely
to have a fine time; and truly they appeared
again in all their ancient majesty.
Julius II. gave the signal, and was followed
by all Europe. This pope, by his
venerable look, recalled the image of the
patriarchs of old. The cardinals, and all
the Church, were eager to follow an example
so commendable. The age was
more enlightened: the ancient disputes
were either forgotten, or only thought of
to lament the injustice of their cause.
The orthodoxy of beards was acknowledged,
and truth shined in all its brightness;
but gloomy envy at length came to
obscure its splendour: some exclaimed
that it was a piece of pride, others a
scandal; and quarrels that should have
been buried for ever in oblivion were
again renewed. Jealousy, under a holy
pretext, raised itself with more daringness
than ever, and occasioned violent animosities.
What writings appeared! what
outrages and phrenzy!... <i>Bella horrida,
bella ... cerno....</i> But let us
not entrench upon such precious matters:
let us rather endeavour, with the same
impartiality, to discover the origin of so
many disturbances.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bessarion, the famous Greek, first, archbishop
of Nice, afterwards, cardinal, and,
at length, patriarch of Constantinople,
came into Italy with the archbishop of
Russia, to endeavour to bring about an
union between the Greek and Latin
churches. Bessarion made no difficulty
of subscribing to the orthodoxy of the
latter; and this was what got him a cardinal’s
hat: his long beard, and that of
his companion, accustomed the court of
Rome to this mode. Bessarion was one
of the stoutest men of his time; every
one longed to look like this illustrious
man, were it only in the fleece on his
chin; and his fine Grecian beard soon
produced a number of Latin ones.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c015'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f74'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r74'>74</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This cardinal’s beard was not so well received in France.
This great man being sent thither as legate, visited, through
policy, the duke of Burgundy before he saw king Lewis XI.
This monarch was so offended at the preference given his enemy,
that, at the first audience he gave this legate, he roughly
seized him by his long beard, and gave him a great deal of abuse.
The patriarch took this affront so near to heart, that he did
not survive it above a year.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Some years after, Julius II. was elected
pope; his youth, which suited but badly
with the majesty of the papacy, determined
him to let his beard grow out, in order to
inspire more respect: he was the first
pope of his time who gave the Church
such a holy and rational example. Clement
VII. one of his successors, did not
imitate him at first; but having been detained
five months in prison by the troops
of Charles of Bourbon, the general of
the emperor’s army, he came out as if
regenerated and triumphant, with his face
enobled with a large, bushy beard, which
he would never part with. This custom
was eagerly adopted by those clergy, who,
by their revenues or exploits, held a distinguished
rank in the Church or State.
It was then that the inferior clergy, and
especially the chapters, strongly opposed
this pretended indecorum. We read,
that, in the reign of Lewis XII. one
Anthony de Langheac, canon of the
church of Paris, abbot and canon of that
of Clermont, counsellor-clerk to the parliament,
and ambassador to the republic
of Venice, could not enter the choir of
the church of Our Lady at Paris with his
long beard. On account of the commission
with which the king had honoured
him, he at length obtained permission to
hear matins, which were then said at
midnight.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c015'><sup>[75]</sup></a> In a little time, they were
not so scrupulous, as all the clergy let
out their beards, even the lowest among
them, in order to give themselves a pontifical
appearance;<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c015'><sup>[76]</sup></a> when, in France,
Francis I. (who might justly boast of
having worn the first beard of his kingdom,)
for œconomical reasons, armed the
enemies of clerical beards with destructive
weapons, and was the occasion of the war
which we are going to speak of.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f75'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r75'>75</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These particulars are inserted in the register of the capitular
resolutions of the year 1505, which may be seen in the archives
of the metropolitical church of Paris.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f76'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r76'>76</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Beroald de Verville</i>, in his <i>Moyen de parvenir</i>, accounts for
 the promptitude with which the priests imitated the popes. “I
will tell you a remark; when the pope has a large beard, the
priests will have the same; if he have a shaved chin, they
will likewise, because they all aim at the papacy.” <i>Moyen
de Parvenir, chap. tom.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This king, in order to get money from
the clergy of his kingdom, says doctor
Zuinger, a contemporary, obtained a
brief from the pope, which ordered all
the French clergy to get themselves
shaved, or else to pay a certain sum to
have permission to wear their beard.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
A contribution from such a body might
be of great service in a time of scarcity.
Francis I. experienced it; for all the
tufted prelates, court ecclesiastics, incumbents,
and expectant clergymen, paid
the money, and retained their beards;
but all the canons of small revenue,
village curates, and poor rectors, freed
themselves from the impost by getting
themselves shaved, and this was the source
of the troubles which disquieted the reign
of Henry II. The difference of the chins
of the clergy of the same kingdom caused
that dark, intestine war which owed its
rise solely to jealousy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now is the time to mention the discussions
which, on account of a beard
affair, began to trouble the ancient capital
of the world. Some seditious, jealous
beings secretly fomented their ruin;
the alarm increased; and beards were
in the utmost danger, when Pierrius Valerianus
undertook their defence. This
man, one of the most learned and most
bearded of his time discussed, in a most
able manner, the cause he undertook;
his book, intitled <i>pro Sacerdotum Barbis</i>,
is dedicated to cardinal Medicis.
A just reasoning and a strength of elocution
are the great qualities of his
discourse; we can perceive that the author
was impressed with his subject; he
quotes a number of authorities, both
sacred and profane, which concur to the
triumph of his cause. He complains
that the respect due to the ministers of
God is already but too much diminished,
without endeavouring to destroy
it by a debasing custom; and adds, that
Jesus never made any law that tended
to alter the Levitican ones, which we
have cited; and that the son of God
himself, having given the example of
this discipline, all Christians ought to
follow it. “What a piece of folly it
is,” cries he, “to pretend that the
beard, which was given by God,
should be unworthy of his creatures.”
He demonstrates, that the canon of
the council of Carthage, which forbids
clergymen to let out their beards, has
been absolutely mutilated: he calls to
his aid the opinion of all the great men
of his time, and several ancient manuscripts,
among others, that which is in
the elector palatine’s library.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c015'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f78'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r78'>78</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Who,” says he, “will dare maintain, that the beard is
not the ornament of man, the symbol of probity and justice;
that it does not give him a grave, stern look; I mean to speak
of those who are determined by reason rather than opinion?
If it be admitted then that the beard is the ornament of an
honest, just man, why should it not be the most decent ornament
for a priest, who ought to be an example of virtue.”
<i>Apologia Joannis Pierii Valeriani belumen.</i> I have seen three
editions of this work.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let us now examine whether this
canon of the council of Carthage, on
which the antibearded gentry found
their anathemas, deserves any confidence.
According to them, these are the words
of the canon of that council: <i>Clericus
nec comam nutriat nec barbam</i>; and these,
according to the sticklers for beards: <i>Clericus
nec comam nutriat, nec barbam radat.</i>
The former forbids to wear long beards;
the latter orders it. So the whole depends
on the adding or suppressing of
the word <i>radat</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seems at first, in favour of bearded
chins, that the termination of the phrase,
<i>nec barbam</i>, should point out the suppression
of a verb, such as <i>radat</i>; and
indeed it would have been much more
simple, and more regular, in the same
sense, to write, <i>Clericus nec comam nec
barbam nutriat</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>This objection, which begins to throw
light on the wiles of the enemies of
beards, would be but weak, were it not
confirmed by a number of triumphant
proofs, and especially by the opinion of
the most celebrated and most laborious
commentators, such as fathers Labbe and
Hardouin, &amp;c. Savaron, in his commentary
on the epistles of St. Sidoin
Apollinarius, warmly maintains, that the
word <i>radat</i> has been suppressed from the
44th canon of this council of Carthage,
and that the custom of wearing long
beards was there precisely ordered. Father
Sirmond, who published some time
after a commentary on the same epistles,
is of the same opinion as Savaron with
respect to the suppression of this word
<i>radat</i>. Charles Dumoulin, in his notes
to the 5th chapter of the 1st record of
the 3d book of the Decretals, assures
us that the text of this canon has been
mutilated, and that we ought to read
<i>nec barbam radat</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us see on what authority the opinion
of these learned men is founded.
The greatest part of the manuscripts of
the councils have the word <i>radat</i>. Pierrius
Valerianus, in his book <i>pro Sacerdotum
Barbis</i>, quotes several, and those
are the least suspected. Father Labbe
has added a note to the canon in question,
in which he numbers the manuscripts
wherein the word <i>radat</i> is found. Father
Hardouin assures us that this important
<i>radat</i> exists in the most authentic manuscripts,
such as those in the libraries of
Corbie, Giblou, Barberin, Paris, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>From these modern proofs, let us pass
to those which antiquity or the contemporaries
of this council ought to furnish
us with. St. Sidoin Apollinarius says
very clearly, speaking of the time of this
council of Carthage: <i>Tum coma brevis &amp;
barba prolixa; At that time people wore
short hair and long beards.</i> Tertullian says
a great deal about this same council; he
maintains that the word <i>radat</i> has been
suppressed in the 44th canon; he cries
out upon the licentiousness of his age,
too fertile in like impositions, and says,
in plain terms! <i>Corrigendum est reponendumque,
juxta fidem veterum exemplarium,
Clericus nec comam nutriat, nec barbam
radat. This canon ought to be corrected,
and, conformably to the fidelity of the old
copies, it should be written, that no clergyman
should wear his hair, or shave his
beard.</i><a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c015'><sup>[79]</sup></a> We see what a distance our short
cloke clergy keep from this edifying regulation.</p>

that is in the epochs of this council of Carthage and the life of
Tertullian. All the commentators and chroniclers place this
council in the year 398, and the death of this learned man about
the year 220 of our æra. According to them, he should have
lived about a century and half before this council. After that,
one is greatly surprised to find, in the works of this same Tertullian,
his observations on this council of Carthage, and still
more so, to find him speak of it as an epoch much earlier than
that in which he was writing; for, when he condemns the supression
of the word <i>radat</i>, he says it ought to be restored conformably
to the fidelity of the old copies, <i>juxta fidem veterum
exemplarium, &amp;c.</i> The anachronism is more than two centuries.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Saint Epiphanius lived in the time of
this council of Carthage: this was a very
learned Saint. Let us see in his writings
if the fathers of those days proclaim the
proscription of long beards. With respect
to the heretic Massalians he speaks
thus. “Is there any thing more contrary
to good morals than their customs?
They cut off their beards, the
mark of manhood, and wear very long
hair. Nevertheless, the sacred expressions
of the constitutions of the apostles
dogmatically prescribe the rules that
are to be observed with respect to the
beard: it is forbidden to cut off any
part of it, for fear lest men should at
length get themselves quite shaved, and
lay hold of the effeminate manners and
luxury of abandoned rakes.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c015'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f80'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r80'>80</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Sed deterius quiddam, ac contrarium ab illis geritur: siquidem
isti barbam, hoc est, propriam viri formam, resecant; capillos
vero, ut plurimum, prolixiores habent. Atqui quod ad barbam
attinet in Apostolorum constitutionbus divino sermone, à degmate
præscribitur, ne ea corrumpatur: hoc est, ne barba ponatur neve
meretricius cultus &amp; ornatus usurpetur, &amp;c.</i> St. Epiphanius
against the heretic Massalians, sect. viii.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>These reproaches, very conclusive in
favour of the partisans of long beards,
will be much more so, and silence the adversaries
of that mark of manhood, if it
be observed, that this same council of
Carthage condemns as heretics those same
Massalians whose shaved chins St. Epiphanius
represents to be a crime. Is it
likely that the Massalians should be condemned
as heretics, and that at the same
time the orthodox clergy should be required
to imitate them, and follow a
custom that is looked upon as the most
scandalous of debauchery; such a law
would be the height of inconsequence.
It is much more reasonable to suppose,
that, instead of the priests’ being ordered
to have their chins shaved, they
were forbidden to do it, that they might
not look like the heretic Massalians. Besides,
what could be opposed to the
council of Barcelona, which was held
some time after that of Carthage, a
council that has never experienced any
contradiction, and in which shaving the
beard is again forbidden? We read in
the third canon, <i>Ut nullus Clericorum
comam nutriat aut barbam radat. Let
no clergyman keep up his hair or shave
his beard.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>We have demonstrated then the fraud
of the antibearded priests, and proved
that the word <i>radat</i> has been suppressed
in the 44th canon. Clergymen therefore,
by this council of Carthage, at which two
hundred and fourteen bishops attended,
are forbidden to cut off their beards, and
the general opinion of the primitive
church, on this point, is established.</p>

<p class='c009'>If we did not know, that private interests
can persuade men to contradict
the best founded maxims, we should be
greatly surprised no doubt to find learned
men of distinction presume to write, that
the general opinion of the primitive
Church condemned long beards. At the
head is cardinal Baronius (tom. i. ad. ann.
48). Let us refer the proselytes of this
credulous writer of legends to <i>le Mercure</i>
for April 1765; they will there find that
a learned Jesuit, father Oudin in his inquiries
concerning beards, proves, that
this cardinal was a bad man, or that he
would not read his St. Epiphanius.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ordinances of the provincial synods
and councils which have made use of this
council of Carthage to justify their forbidding
the clergy to wear long beards,
should therefore be void of course: the
edifice falls of itself when the foundation
is undermined.</p>

<p class='c009'>But let us return to the defenders of
beards of the sixteenth century: Pierrius
was not the only champion that appeared
on this occasion. Adrian Junius, an ingenious
physician, and distinguished for
his learning, in his commentary on the
hair of the head, says a great deal about
clerical beards, with as much eloquence
and more erudition than his predecessor;
he relates every thing that had not been
advantageously said before on the subject,
and is not afraid to take a review of the
opinions and examples of all the ancients;
he establishes, that even when there should
be neither law, constitution, nor council
which ordered the priests to preserve their
beards, they ought to do it, because it
gives the wearer a grave, stern, respectable
look, which becomes the ministers of the
altar, and that their thus changing the
nature of God’s work, in order to please
mankind, is, for them, a very criminal
piece of luxury.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c015'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

ii. de rasurâ capillorum pariter &amp; barbæ.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>These works produced their effect: nevertheless
pope Paul III. being displeased
with the severe tone of Pierrius and the
sharp reproaches which he threw out against
the manners of the clergy of the
age, would not seem to comply thereto;
but without issuing a formal decree against
beards, as was talked of, he contented
himself with commanding a cardinal
briefly to order the priests to get themselves
shaved.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c015'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f82'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r82'>82</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Beroalde ridicules the shaved priests of those days. He
says it was ordered so, <i>in order that the regret which they have at
not daring nor being willing to partake of the pleasures of this
world, may in no wise appear; to which you may add that they
ought to be merry</i> (venite exultemus), <i>and that theirs is a state
of perpetual joy, which must be made appear so, though it were
not; and this is the reason why they wear their chins shaved, because
 a man thus polished up about the gills is always laughing ...
from thence came this canon of the council of Quarante</i>: <span class='fss'>THE
PRIESTS SHALL SHAVE WITH HOG’S SWARD</span>, <i>in order that
they may always appear laughing, dainty-mouthed, airy, &amp;c.</i>
Moyen de parvenir, chap. <i>Allegation.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The major part paid but little attention
to this ordinance; some, more scrupulous,
obeyed, but not without repugnancy:
there were a few of the latter however,
according to Gentian Hervet, who had
reason to repent of their exactness: among
others, he speaks of one Leonicus Thomeus,
an old man of ninety, who was no
sooner shaved, according to the decree of
the pontiff, than he was seized with such
a confounded tooth-ach, that he was obliged
to solicit the pope’s clemency.
Cardinal Bembe sent him forthwith a permission
to wear his beard a reasonable
length.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us now proceed to France, where
the pope’s brief, obtained by Francis I.
gave beginning to the envy which the
shaved priests bore the bearded ones.
Their jealousy had been brewing a long
time, and only waited, to show itself, for
the death of that prince, whose orders
seemed still to be respected. Their animosity,
already too much increased by
this obstacle, broke out at length on the
person of William Duprat, the son of the
famous chancellor of that name: he was
returning from the council of Trent,
where his eloquence had made him conspicuous,
and was going to take possession
of the bishopric of Clermont, which he
had been given some time before. The
reader should take along with him that
he had one of the finest beards in the
kingdom. One Easter-day, when he came
to his cathedral church to perform divine
service, he found the gates of the choir
shut; three dignitaries of the chapter
were waiting for him at the entrance:
one of them held a razor in his hand, the
other a pair of scissars, and the third the
book of the ancient statutes of that
church, and pointing with his finger to
these words; <i>barbis rasis</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the sight of this frightful preparation,
the prelate clearly perceived that
they aimed at his beard, the dearest object
of his attention; two of these fatal enemies
seemed to threaten it with the instruments
with which they were armed;
and the third kept crying: Reverend
father in God, <i>barbis rasis</i>. The impatient
dean had already laid hold of this
episcopal fleece, when our bearded bishop
stopped him, and being a little recovered
from his fright, he endeavoured to convince
him of the impropriety of working
on such a great holy-day, and that it was
better to defer this operation ’till the next
day; but the temporizing prelate’s eloquence
made no impression on the minds
of these intractable men; the unmerciful
dean kept his hold: full of indignation
at this mortifying insult, and terrified for
the fate of his cherished beard, William
Duprat suddenly took to his heels, crying:
<i>I save my beard, and quit my bishopric</i>.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c015'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
He immediately repaired to his country-house
at Beauregard, three leagues from
Clermont, and swore he would never more
live in that capital.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f83'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r83'>83</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>William Major, a doctor of the Sorbone and canon of the
church of Clermont, in a work intituled <i>defence de feu M.
Savaron, &amp;c.</i> maintains, against abbot Faydit, that this anecdote
is a story of his invention. In order to free his old brethren
from the imputation of having designed to shear their bishop, in
the warmth of his zeal, he breaks out into invectives against his
adversary; but he proves it least, in his long refutation, that
the canons saw with grief a long beard on the chin of their
bishop, and that when the latter wished to be present at some
synod, he was obliged to ask permission of his chapter to come
without being shaved. He quotes several resolutions of the
chapter, by which he was granted this permission.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was in this place of retirement, that,
being violently moved at the affront
which his beard had received, he fell ill,
and died of grief.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c015'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f84'>

</div>

<p class='c009'>These fatal news made all the bearded
clergy tremble. The standard of the revolt
was set up, and the destruction of
all clerical beards determined on; but
Henry II. always took their part. Every
new bishop put his beard under this king’s
protection. The letter which he was
obliged to write, the 27th December,
1551, to the clergy of the city of Troyes,
who refused Anthony Caraciole for bishop
on account of his long beard, is a proof
of the interest he took in the beards of
the clergy of his kingdom; “Dear and
well beloved, it is said, but which we
doubt, that you make a difficulty of
receiving into your church our well
beloved and trusty cousin Anthony Caraciole,
your bishop, without his being
shaved first, in consequence of some
statutes which you have been used to
observe in such cases: therefore, we
have thought fit to write you these
presents to request you will not stand
upon this matter, but, to oblige us,
excuse his compliance, as we mean to
send him for a short time to some
place out of the kingdom on business
that concerns us, where we would not
have him go without his said beard.
Assuring ourselves that you will do so,
we shall say no more, but that, by
complying with our request, you will
greatly oblige us, and may God continue
his protection towards you. Given
at Fontainbleau, &amp;c.”<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c015'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f85'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r85'>85</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This letter is taken <i>de veterum Scriptorum &amp; amplissima
collectio</i>, vol. i. by Martenne and Durand.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The pacific tone which Henry II. made
use of had but little effect on the inferior
clergy; the war was too much kindled;
every day produced new scenes and new
attacks by the mutineers, and new attempts
by the king to quiet them. The
canons of Mans refused to receive cardinal
Angennes for their bishop, on account
of his long beard. The cardinal
wrote to them to prepossess them in his
favour, and the king wrote to them likewise
to calm them, but they would listen
to nothing, and the prince was obliged
to send an absolute order to the chapter
of Mans, requiring them to receive the
said bishop without insisting on his being
shaved. Some years after, the canons of
Orleans made a difficulty of receiving
Morvillier for their bishop: the king
was again obliged to write to the canons,
to desire them to receive him with his
beard. The canons of Amiens likewise
refused their bishop, and he was obliged
to have a famous law-suit with them to
sustain the cause of his long beard.</p>

<p class='c009'>About the same time, there was the
greatest difficulty to get Peter Lescot de
Clagny received canon of Our Lady at
Paris with his long beard: he had need to
join to his personal merit the qualities of
counsellor to the court, almoner to the
king, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after, the Sorbone gravely decided,
that a long beard was contrary to
sacerdotal modesty.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c015'><sup>[86]</sup></a> At the same time
the clergy, by an edict of the parliament
of Toulouse, were forbidden to wear their
beards.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c015'><sup>[87]</sup></a>  But persecution strengthens
what it is eager to destroy: the beards
triumphed in their turn; people even
went so far as to give them a more agreeable
form; they wore them frizzled, as
appears by the order of the clergy of
Burgundy against frizzled beards. Anthony
Hotman wrote at that time his
<i>Pogonias</i>, or dialogue on heads of hair
and beards; he concludes with the elogy
of the latter. In 1576 there was a poem
in quatrains printed, intitled: <i>Eloges des
barbes rousses</i>. In 1539, there was a book
published, intitled <i>la Pogonologie</i>, by R.
D. P. printed at Rennes, in 8vo. and
Gentian Hervet wrote three essays on
beards. We see, by these different writings,
that, in those days, people were
more taken up with their beards, than
now.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f86'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r86'>86</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The 1st of July 1561, this celebrated assembly ordered all
the members of their university, doctors, bachelors, &amp;c. to
wear their beards shaved, &amp;c. <i>Non deferant barbas &amp; veniant tonsi.</i></p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f87'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r87'>87</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The author of a book intituled Pogonologia, says on this
occasion, that those, who wished to take advantage of the
equivocation in this edict of the French verb <i>porter</i> (which signifies
to <i>carry</i> as well as to <i>wear</i>) had their beards <i>carried</i> by
their servants.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As the best things have their traducers,
the beard met with one in this Gentian
Hervet, a learned Orleanese. He wrote
a Latin discourse against beards; but in
a little time, being staggered by the forcible
reasons of his adversaries, he wrote
a second, in which he advanced, that it
was indifferent whether a priest wore his
beard or not; in short, carried away by
the force of truth, he at length wrote a
third, in which he ably maintains that a
priest absolutely ought to have a long
beard on his chin.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c015'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f88'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r88'>88</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first of these discourses is intitled, <i>de radendâ barbâ
Oratio</i>; the second, <i>de vel alendâ vel radendâ barbâ</i>; and the
third, <i>de alendâ barbâ</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Notwithstanding its success, its numerous
apologists, and powerful partisans,
the beard had still enemies; the provinces
especially were the theatre of
secret cabals, where, far from the court
and the bearded powers, plots of vengeance
were easily contrived, and their
effects often broke out in provincial councils;
and most of these councils, actuated
by contrary sentiments, contradicted each
other in their decisions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two provincial councils, held at Narbonne
the same year, 1551, ordered all
the priests of the diocese to shave themselves
at least once a month; another
council, held at Rheims in 1583, only
recommended the hair of the upper lip to
be cut off, in order to be able to receive
the communion without any obstacle. A
council of Bagneres, of the same year,
gives the same orders. A council of
Rouen, in 1581, orders the priests to
shave off their beards entirely, which it is
looked upon (says the council) as debasing
for a minister of the altar to wear.
A council of Malines, in 1579, absolutely
condemns the custom of wearing beards,
whilst another council, held in the same
town, eight years after, declares nearly
the contrary, ordering only a little of the
hair of the upper lip to be cut away.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c015'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
All that one can conclude from all these
provincial councils is, that the rage of
party was gotten into the very sanctuary
of truth to propagate disorder and irresolution.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f89'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r89'>89</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See, for all these provincial councils, <i>Acta Conciliorum</i> of
father Hardouin.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>All these ephemeral ordinances had no
other effect than to prolong the reign of
the beards of priests; they still flourished
on their chins, when the laity no longer
wore them. Fashion brought about, in a
short time, what all these redoubled efforts
had been unable to effect during
more than a century. The popes retained
their beards a good while, and the first,
who appeared entirely shaved, was Clement
XI. who lived at the beginning of
this century. Most of the clergy left it
off insensibly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Augustins, who still wore their
beards, were ashamed of not being in the
fashion as usual; they sent the famous
father Eustace, of the Petty Augustins of
Paris, to Rome, to obtain leave to shave
their chins. They say, this father Eustace
made use of great address on the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were however some true believers,
faithful observers of the Levitican
law and the precepts of the primitive
church, people on whom fashion has no
influence, who courageously preserved
their beards ’till towards the middle of
the reign of Lewis XIV. A very respectable
rector was one of them: when
the bishop visited his diocese, he appeared
with a venerable beard on his chin. The
prelate exclaimed greatly against his thus
making himself look like a patriarch,
whilst he, his bishop and lord, was shaved;
and he formally ordered him to get rid
of his long beard. In vain did the poor
rector cite the example of the pope then
living, that of St. Francis of Sales, &amp;c.;
the bishop was inexorable, and the rector
did not think fit to obey. Irritated at his
obstinacy, the prelate sent him a writ to
banish him from his living. By a singular
piece of inattention, the place of banishment
was left blank; the rector filled it up
with <i>Versailles</i>, and immediately repaired
to the residence of the kings of France.
He affected to throw himself continually in
the way of Lewis XIV.: his long beard
was at length remarked by the king, who
had him called, and asked him what was
his business at court, and why he had such
an extraordinary beard. The parson related
his adventure to his majesty, who
as pleased with it so much, that he sent
back this grave pastor to his flock, and
highly blamed the bishop for such a ridiculous
whim.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c015'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f90'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r90'>90</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See the 8th vol. of <i>Causes Célébres, a canon refused for being
too little</i>. This adventure furnished matter for a little burlesque
poem, intitled <i>l’Exilé à Versailles</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Since this, beards have entirely disappeared,
and have only been let grow out
on the chins of the Capuchins; and religious
jealousy has pursued them even to
this last retrenchment: how many clamours
have they not caused among the
other monks! and what a number of
libels and polemical productions have
they had to endure!<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c015'><sup>[91]</sup></a> Such are the books
intitled <i>le Rasibus</i> or <i>le procés fait à la
barbe des Capucins</i>;<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c015'><sup>[92]</sup></a> <i>la Guerre seraphique,
ou Histoire des périls qu’a courus la barbe des
Capucins par les violentes attaques des Cordeliers</i>;<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c015'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
<i>les Capucins sans barbe</i>, &amp;c. all
works of envy or vengeance, which I
shall be careful how I mention on account
of my great dislike to satire. Not
satisfied with writing, the enemies of the
Capuchins’ beards have employed the
most violent and most unwarrantable
means. The fatal catastrophe which
happened, in 1761, to the Capuchins of
the town of Ascoli, in the limits of Ancona,
proves how much monkish vengeance
is cruel: we read as follows in the
Utrecht Gazette of that time. “Our
reverend fathers, the Capuchins, have
no longer any beards. One of their
lay brethren, a cook in the monastery,
having put a good dose of opium in
their meat, unbearded all of them
whilst they were asleep, and then forsook
the order. The Capuchins are
so ashamed of this droll adventure,
that they no longer dare appear abroad.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c015'><sup>[94]</sup></a>
Is it not clear to every body
that base jealousy was what prompted
this wicked brother to commit this deed?
And is it not easy to discern the vengeance
of an Italian monk in this attack
on so many respectable beards? After
so many outrages, how is it possible that
bearded chins can any longer stand their
ground? Without the express order to
wear long beards, which is in the <i>Bullarium</i>
of the brethren of that order, they would
long ere this have abandoned the sad
remains of the ancient majesty of the
patriarchs.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a> They little thought formerly,
that their long beards, which they
looked upon as a respectable ornament,
would one day become an object of public
contempt; or that it would make part
of their outward humility, which they
formerly made consist solely in the colour
and price of their clothes; but time perverts
every thing.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c015'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f91'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r91'>91</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Several communities of Capuchins have been reproached
with having concealed their beards on certain occasions. It is
said, that those of Monpellier, about the beginning of Feb. 1731,
played, in the great dining-hall of the monastery, the tragedy
of <span class='sc'>Polieucpe</span>, and danced between the acts, to celebrate the
arrival of the provincial; and that, in order to play the women’s
parts, they put their beards in a parchment thing made like a
chin-cloth, painted flesh colour. The Capuchins of the great
monastery at Lyons, in 1757, likewise acted a play before their
friends and their brethren of the second monastery; they played
three days running <i>les Fourberies de Scapin</i>: the reverend father,
who played the part of Scapin, did it great justice. They add,
that one of these reverend gentlemen danced a Harlequin dance
with much grace and suppleness, and that, to remedy the inconvenience
of long beards, they put them in pink taffety bags.
The Capuchins at Grenoble and Vienne likewise acted a play,
and covered their beards in the same manner. We relate these
anecdotes, which were formerly printed by the enemies of the
Capuchins, to show, that every opportunity has been taken to
attack the beards of that religions order. These friars, at present,
have no occasion to be afraid of similar reproaches; they
act no plays, neither do they conceal their beards, and they make
themselves equally respected by the gravity of their appearance
and the extent of their learning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whilst several sovereigns are taken up
with the destruction of monasteries or the
lessening of the number of monks, the
Portuguese minister has just distinguished
himself, not by destroying, but rendering
them more respectable, by taking them
from worldly practices, and restoring them
all their ancient gravity: it was ordered,
in 1784, that all the monks, of every
order without distinction, should let their
beards grow out entirely.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c015'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

Church and of all the pontiffs,
and the decision of two councils, are
the grounds on which the obligation,
which the Christian clergy are under of
wearing long beards, is supported. What
is there to oppose against so many respectable
authorities? The fashion? A
heathen emperor opposed, to those who
reproached him with not shaving his chin,
the austerity of his manners, and replied:

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>THE Capuchins, Carthusians, all the
Portuguese monks, the Russian clergy
and peasants, all the priests of the Greek
Church, the German Jews, and the Anabaptists,
are the only ones that wear
beards in Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most of the inhabitants of Asia wear
whiskers or beards more or less long
according to their age.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the followers of the law of Mahomet
wear whiskers ’till they are forty,
when they let their beards grow out, and
preserve them afterwards all their lives.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c015'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f99'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r99'>99</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is in Turkey, where the dignity of a long beard is of the
first importance.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>All the north part of Africa is inhabited
by bearded people.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nature has denied a beard to the different
nations of blacks who inhabit the
interior and but little known parts of that
quarter of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>In most of the islands of the Pacific
ocean, the men preserve their beards, and
some of them stain them different colours.</p>

<p class='c009'>The author of <i>Recherches philosophiques
sur les Américains</i>, doctor Robertson in
his <i>History of America</i>, and many other
respectable writers, maintain that all the
original natives of America have absolutely
no hair on their chins; they except
only the Esquimaux, (the inhabitants
of North America,) who wear beards, and
are unlike the natives of the other parts.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c015'><sup>[100]</sup></a>
However, captain Cook says, that the
want of beard in some of the American
nations, proceeds less from a defect of
nature than their custom of plucking
them out by the roots to a greater or
less degree: this he observed at Nootka,
in his third voyage round the world: all
the old men he saw on the west coast of
America wore thick, bushy beards, but
which were sleeked in the same manner as
their hair generally is.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f100'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r100'>100</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It has been proved, not long since, that the Esquimaux are
descended from a colony of Danes and Norwegians who came
through Iceland, and landed in this part of America, several
centuries before Christopher Columbus discovered it. This is
supported by the history of the times and by monuments of the
arts and religion of the Europeans found in that country. See
<i>Histoire des decouvertes &amp; de la navigation dans le Nord</i>, by <i>J. R.
Forster</i>. I have read a French manuscript by Mr. P. D. L. C.,
in which the European origin of the Esquimaux is proved in the
most incontestable manner.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In the inner parts of America, Captain
Carver met Savages with long beards on
their chins. The following is his answer
to those who have denied their having
any. “After the age of puberty, their
bodies, in their natural state, are covered
with hair in the same manner as
those of the Europeans. The men, indeed,
esteem a beard very unbecoming,
and take great pains to get rid of it,
nor is there any ever to be perceived
on their faces, except when they
grow old, and become inattentive to
their appearance....</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Nawdowessies, and the remote
nations pluck them out with bent
pieces of hard wood, formed into a
kind of nippers; whilst those who have
communication with the Europeans
procure from them wire, which they
twist into a screw or worm; applying
this to the part, they press the rings
together, and with a sudden twitch
draw out all the hairs that are enclosed
between them.”<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c015'><sup>[101]</sup></a> <i>Carver’s Travels,
page 225.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>The mask of Montezuma’s armour,
(the last king of Mexico,) preserved at
Brussels, and on which there are very
long whiskers, seems to confirm the observations
of captains Cook and Carver:
it is evident that the Americans would
not have imitated this ornament of man,
if nature had not presented them with
the model.</p>

<p class='c009'>Therefore, the observations made by
captain Cook on the west coast of America,
those of captain Carver in the inner
part of the continent, and the monument
of the ancient customs of Mexico, which
present us with Montezuma’s whisker’d
mask, prove that the assertion of the historians
against American beards is at least
doubtful, is it is not destitute of foundation.</p>

<p class='c009'>According to the observations of all
travellers, it is certain that the men who
inhabit the temperate zones, and are most
advantageously favoured by nature, are
likewise most bearded: it may likewise
be remarked, that those, who bestow most
attention to shaving, are the most subject
to petticoat government, and consequently
the vainest.</p>

<div class='footnote c016' id='f101'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r101'>101</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The islanders of Sumatra pluck out their beards in the
same manner. (See Cook’s third voyage, vol. iii.)</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c013'>CHAP. XI.<br /> <br /><i>The <span class='sc'>Conclusion</span>.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c014'>WILL reason, and the constant desire
of nature at length determine the
men of the present day to adopt the custom
of long beards? I don’t believe it.
The power of working such a revolution
is reserved for opinion and fashion. But
there are men in society who ought to be
independent of these two wavering powers:
these are those that govern the people,
and whom religion and the state
have entrusted with their interests and
powers. These mediators between God
and man, between the law and the citizen,
who are not of the ordinary class,
should be distinguished from those that
are so. Regularity of conduct is not
their first duty; it is the art of giving
themselves, by means of their dress, an
air of wisdom and gravity: all the virtues
which their state requires are not sufficient,
they must likewise have the appearance.
People see only by their eyes;
it is only physical objects that have the
power of captivating their veneration or
exciting their contempt. If a man, who
wishes to gain the respect and confidence
of the public, does not forsake the
manners, customs, and fashions of the
world, he will soon perceive the respect
and confidence he enjoyed disappear.
Not only the man, but the character with
which he is invested, will lose its consideration;
he will be like the wooden
king which Jupiter sent to the frogs: his
want of dignity drew on him the contempt
and insults of his aquatic people.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of all the exterior means that can
attract the admiration of the people, a
long beard is beyond a doubt the most
powerful, the only one that is not sought
after, the only natural one, and which
cannot be reasonably taxed with vanity
or pride. Our forefathers always thought,
that both religion and morals were interested
in the support of this ornament
of man’s face. And truly, what priests
were ever more respected than those old
white bearded ones of the ancient religions,
especially the patriarchs of the
Israelites? In the beginning of Christianity,
what veneration did not the
grave, stern faces of the fathers of the
Church command? Where are these
divine men? and where the respect due
to the ministers of God?</p>

<p class='c009'>If the constant seeing of objects, which
have the appearance of grandeur and
majesty, stir up the soul and give it a
spring; the sight of objects which have
the appearance of weakness insensibly
enervate and degrade it. The soul appears
in the face: the man, who beholds
in another, only the picture of effeminacy,
soon learns to withdraw his esteem from
him, and to no longer respect him; pious
veneration, sincere consideration, and cordial
friendship, are replaced by politeness
and decorum, which are only the gloss
of interest and egotism; people no longer
fulfill the duties of society, nor do
good for their own satisfaction; and if
men’s outward, effeminate appearance is
not the sole cause of all these evils, it
greatly contributes towards them.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the vast regions of the East, where
long beards are highly esteemed, hospitality,
filial piety, and fidelity in engagements
are the premier virtues: men
respect one another there. Let us take a
people whom the same law subjects nearly
to the same morals as ours, the Greek
or Latin Christians who are under the
Mahometan government: adultery, among
them, is almost unknown, and yet
the women are not confined; but they
respect their husbands, and these husbands
wear long beards.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where is filial piety now-a-days? will
the sad wrinkled faces of our old men,
which incite our disgust and contempt,
prevail above the sweet majesty of a long,
white beard? Where is conjugal fidelity?
was it ever less observed than at the time,
and in the countries where men appear
before a sex, that ought to be under
their subjection, in an effeminate dress?
How many are there, in this shameful
age, the sad victims of this truth!</p>

<p class='c009'>I repeat it; outward appearance is one
of the great movers of a monarchial
state, especially among a superficial nation.
Deprive subjects of their popular
notions of decorum, and of their customs,
and people in place of their ornaments,
manner, plausibleness, and grave imposing
appearance: you will destroy most
of the social virtues; there will be no
more energy nor spirit in the people; all
their mental faculties will become languid,
if you cease to feed their imaginations
with this aliment.</p>

<p class='c009'>An extravagant turn of mind has produced
many a hero; reason, by analysing
every thing, has discouraged and
slackened the course of our actions, and
luxury, &amp;c. &amp;c. have completed the work.
But what a generation is ours!</p>

<p class='c009'>In times of yore, Diogenes, with a
lantern in his hand, went through all the
streets of Athens in broad day to seek a
man: what could he find now in our great
capital? breathing skeletons, women,
children, horses, and that multitude of
wheel carriages, the incommodious use
of which crushes some to pieces and
deprives others of the little strength
they had left. Would he find men
among these reverend gentry, whose
toilet is their chief employment? Their
chief merit is a mind fraught with borrowed
trifles. Look at this modern
Chrysostom, powdered and close shaved,
repairing to an old coquet’s, a girl’s
of the town, or the minister’s. Every
where he repeats the same flattering
phrases. With the one, an intriguer or
base flatterer; with the other, an absolute
libertine or a ridiculous puppy, he becomes
every where necessary animal;
in short, a downright plaything and piece
of toilet furniture. Nothing gives this
charming fellow any uneasiness; he is
any thing they will have him, and will
think just what they please: in a word,
he performs the dapper parson admirably.</p>

<p class='c009'>Would our wise Athenian have found
men among our Parisians? The children
are men, and the men, old men,
and they persist in fleeing from nature,
which begins to be tired of pursuing
them. By their weak, frivolous minds,
and pale effeminate looks, one would
take them for women in disguise. Cloyed
with all sorts of enjoyments, they know
no other virtue than the talent of being
agreeable, nor other vice than its reverse.</p>

<p class='c009'>Would he at length find men in these
delicate warriors who daily give their
subalterns the example of effeminacy?</p>

<p class='c009'>But do you, French soldiers, the precious
remains of patriotism and national
valour, always preserve the outward appearance
of it; be particularly attentive to
keep in your countenances this sign of valour,
vigour, and intrepidity; retain those
fierce looking whiskers which are the attribute
of heroes; and remember that they
were the ornament of Turenne, Condé, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would therefore be advantageous
for those, who, by their situation or
dignity, are intended to command others,
to instruct them, or to merit their confidence,
to let their beards grow out
quite, whilst the soldier should only wear
whiskers, which give a man a martial,
brisk look.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should the example of some great men,
or some political event, at length revive
the mode of long beards, our delicateness
and urbanity might again be reconciled
with the majesty of man. Would it not
be possible for people of good taste to
give the beard an agreeable form, in the
same manner as was done some centuries
ago? This attention, employing those
who take a great deal of pains about
adorning their pretty persons, would divert
them perhaps from a more dangerous
luxury. Besides the respect of
one man to another, and of one sex to
that which is its superior; this custom
would produce another advantage. The
resemblance of the two sexes seems to
incline men to those shameful debaucheries
which formerly soiled the glory of
Greece and Rome, debaucheries that
one hardly dares mention, and which a
more particular distinction between men
and women would greatly contribute to
destroy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It can never be denied; a man should
appear what nature made him: this is
the opinion of an illustrious philosopher
and profound moralist.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c015'><sup>[102]</sup></a> I cannot better
conclude than with his own words. “A
perfect man and a perfect woman should
no more be alike in mind than in face:
these silly imitations of sex are the
height of folly; they make the wise
man laugh and the lover run away....
In short, I take it, that, unless one
be five feet six inches high, have a
firm, tenor voice, and a beard on his
chin, he should not pretend to be
a man.”</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
